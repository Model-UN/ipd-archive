<p>On this Sunday there seems to be many updates on what has been happening around the world! The international community has been faced with many different challenges and situations! Let’s see how these different groups have handled these crises!</p>



<p>United States Cabinet:</p>



<p>Ex CIA Director has been replaced with a deputy of CIA after having been fired, gone to trial and found guilty as a whistleblower. Ex-CIA director’s crime was leaked sensitive documents to the Chinese government and they are carrying out their sentence in Guantamo Bay. Most Cabinet members did not have nice things to say about the former CIA Director so it seems that the replacement of the CIA director is a win-win situation</p>



<p>United Nations Security Council:</p>



<p>The united nations security council seems split on how to handle the potential new nation in Belarus. A group led by Kenya and Mexico want to involve themselves in the new nation’s potential development to prevent further conflict, while the group of China and Russia are drafting legislation to remove themselves from the development of the new nation and be impartial with the goal of stopping conflict. Let’s see which plan works out!</p>



<p>Cabinet of China:</p>



<p>The Cabinet of China is successful in their cyber security attacks against the United States. China’s “green energy” plan  has also been revealed as a trojan horse plan to gain control and influence in the crumbling democracy of Belarus. <br></p>



<p>update:</p>



<p>China nukes everyone.</p>



<p>Cabinet of Russia:</p>



<p>The Russian cabinet has assassinated their leader Vladimir Putin. They also have been working on finding a replacement leader. Good luck to them</p>



<p>Cabinet of Germany:</p>



<p>Saturday Night the Cabinet of Germany was able to hear from two refugees on their experience of immigration. This morning when returning to Germany to report i was informed that they have changed their nation’s name to Nicki Minaj Nation of Barbz Leaders. They also threatened to conquer China!</p>

<p>Cabinet of turkey:</p>



<p>The President of Turkey screamed at the Russian Cabinet ”take a big fat L” this morning. It is not known why this happened. In other news the Turkish Minister of Treasury and Finance was executed in response to his proposed coup against President Erdogan. <br></p>



<p>Bill and Melinda gates foundation: </p>



<p>The foundation accuses Pfizer of pocketing over 2 million dollars that was donated to them for vaccine distribution in developing countries.</p>



<p>Defense leadership forum:</p>



<p>Due to arguments between Lockhead Martin and U.S Rep Mike Rogers Lockheed Martin no longer sells to the United States.</p>



<p>That is all see you next Sunday!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As working papers were being written on solutions for the distribution of covid vaccines, Turkey first joined Lebanon&#8217;s bloc VACC, which supported funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. After discovering their plans and perspective, they decided to switch and work with Israel in their bloc DDD (Distribution, Discipline, and Dedication).</p>



<p>An angered Lebanon confronted Turkey, outraged at Israel&#8217;s racism for not vaccinating Palestinians and questioned Turkey&#8217;s support.</p>



<p>Later, Senegal, one of the members of the DDD bloc, approached VACC to see if they could collaborate to make sure that the papers would pass, which they made very clear. However, on orders of Lebanon, Senegal was kicked out on allegations of spying.</p>



<p>Lebanon then spreads the conspiracy theory through the press that Israel was manipulating the situation to benefit themselves economically.</p>



<p>As many were now against Lebanon, a coalition was created to prevent Lebanon&#8217;s paper from passing, including DDD and other smaller blocs. However, this angered Lebanon once again; they decided to create fake messages involving Turkey spreading fake news to the press.</p>



<p>An anonymous statement was released saying &#8220;the VACC bloc has to make false posts and give false statements because they know that on their own, they won&#8217;t win. In the VACC paper, they talk lots about the importance of education and in being informed, but meanwhile, they feed conspiracy theories to other newspapers to try and undermine other papers.&#8221;</p>



<p>More to come as the story develops.</p>

<p>Two Belarusian refugees were welcomed by the Cabinet of Germany to share their emotional testimonies of immigration. They both seemed hopeless for the situation in Belarus and pleaded with the German Cabinet members to look at the immigration crisis more humanely. </p>



<p>“We are not statistics,” shares Marina Pikic. Marina shared that most of her life she has been a refugee and she has lost her homeland and family and friends because of the political turmoil in Bosnia; even with her migration to Germany she still struggles to get adequate health care and is food insecure.</p>



<p>Another refugee that accompanied Ms. Pikic was Mr. Saif Raza Azim. He shared that he lost his wife and daughter and was not upset at their enemy but how inhumanely the world treated refugees.</p>



<p>Th experience last night of listening to both Saif and Marina should be a reminder to the international community that refugees are people and that policy should be considered with caution and care. </p>



<p>Germany had the privilege of meeting with the two refugees one on one. Could this affect their future immigration policies in the future?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Russia and Belarus are known to be official allies since 1995, but in light of recent events, the relationship between the two seems to have taken a rocky turn. Belarus is currently in the middle of a migratory problem, with numerous emigrants from Syria being denied entrance to the European Union. As a solution, Russia came up with the idea to invite said emigrants into the country. Russia believes that in doing this, their economy might be benefited and the perception of them the international committee has might be positively improved. However, Russia isn’t taking into account that in doing this, it is risking the country going into crisis.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large" datatext=""><img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Location_Belarus_Europe.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Belarus does not seem fond of the idea either, as they consider it a back-handed move from Russia. President of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko, sent a letter to the Russian cabinet expressing his disapproval. He accused Russia of treason, and stated that he expected more understanding towards the intentions Belarusian people have. Belarus wanted to pressure the European Union into accepting Syrians into their territory, and claimed that if Russia took the emigrants in, Belarus would loose its leverage. This resulted in Belarus stating that ”Not only will [they] block [Russia’s] efforts to withdraw refugees from the border, but [they] will also reconsider [their] relationship from this point moving forward”.</p>



<p>In response, Russia wrote a letter back to the Belarusian government&#8217; in which they stated that they hoped to put the misunderstanding behind them. Having been allies for a large amount of time, Russia claimed that maintaining an amicable relationship with Belarus was of utmost importance to the nation. As of right now, Belarus is yet to issue any response.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: rgb(252, 239, 69);">I</span> had a chance to talk to ministers of the People&#8217;s Republic of China Friday evening and discussed social outlets and economic troubles. Speaking from social outlets, this anonymous stand point is something quite intriguing.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think you can tell but our cabinet [is] ineffective with passing directives, and our government isn&#8217;t happy with it. We have classified reports that our citizens think our president isn&#8217;t taking enough action with the issues on Taiwan and still, our cabinet is being ineffective with passing directives and assisting our leader improving his public image by taking concrete action,&#8221; a source with knowledge of the council said.</p>



<p>Further more, China&#8217;s president Xi Jinping and his council are focused working on their social outlets and talking to other cabinets like Germany, Russia and the U.S. and also bettering their media production for better propaganda but further upmost their issues with Taiwan which has been ongoing for quite some time and from social media debates such from earlier where breaking news struck with Taiwanese official saying &#8220;pooh bear got crushed by a building&#8221; in the reference to the president, who was outraged on China&#8217;s mainland. </p>



<p>Due to that post the president was angered, and when asked what he wants to do from that tweet, his response was, &#8220;I want Taiwan to suffer.&#8221; And when asked how they were, there was no further discussion due to privacy reasons.</p>



<p>One of the last topics I wanted to cover from this conference was China&#8217;s economic hardships with housing and domestic issues. Going along with what the Minister of Finance thinks from when the president went missing, the cabinet issued [from in the meeting] that their own debt and income housing was because of their economic issues and because they can help with housing bubbles which lead to drastic price increases caused by excess demand. Which the chinese cabinet is furthering more into improving and providing new energy such as &#8220;green energy&#8221; and working to make their nation as best a  possible which from the Chairman of National development &#8221; China is a great nation&#8221;.</p>
