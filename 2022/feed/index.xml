<p>On this Sunday there seems to be many updates on what has been happening around the world! The international community has been faced with many different challenges and situations! Let’s see how these different groups have handled these crises!</p>



<p>United States Cabinet:</p>



<p>Ex CIA Director has been replaced with a deputy of CIA after having been fired, gone to trial and found guilty as a whistleblower. Ex-CIA director’s crime was leaked sensitive documents to the Chinese government and they are carrying out their sentence in Guantamo Bay. Most Cabinet members did not have nice things to say about the former CIA Director so it seems that the replacement of the CIA director is a win-win situation</p>



<p>United Nations Security Council:</p>



<p>The united nations security council seems split on how to handle the potential new nation in Belarus. A group led by Kenya and Mexico want to involve themselves in the new nation’s potential development to prevent further conflict, while the group of China and Russia are drafting legislation to remove themselves from the development of the new nation and be impartial with the goal of stopping conflict. Let’s see which plan works out!</p>



<p>Cabinet of China:</p>



<p>The Cabinet of China is successful in their cyber security attacks against the United States. China’s “green energy” plan  has also been revealed as a trojan horse plan to gain control and influence in the crumbling democracy of Belarus. <br></p>



<p>update:</p>



<p>China nukes everyone.</p>



<p>Cabinet of Russia:</p>



<p>The Russian cabinet has assassinated their leader Vladimir Putin. They also have been working on finding a replacement leader. Good luck to them</p>



<p>Cabinet of Germany:</p>



<p>Saturday Night the Cabinet of Germany was able to hear from two refugees on their experience of immigration. This morning when returning to Germany to report i was informed that they have changed their nation’s name to Nicki Minaj Nation of Barbz Leaders. They also threatened to conquer China!</p>

<p>Cabinet of turkey:</p>



<p>The President of Turkey screamed at the Russian Cabinet ”take a big fat L” this morning. It is not known why this happened. In other news the Turkish Minister of Treasury and Finance was executed in response to his proposed coup against President Erdogan. <br></p>



<p>Bill and Melinda gates foundation: </p>



<p>The foundation accuses Pfizer of pocketing over 2 million dollars that was donated to them for vaccine distribution in developing countries.</p>



<p>Defense leadership forum:</p>



<p>Due to arguments between Lockhead Martin and U.S Rep Mike Rogers Lockheed Martin no longer sells to the United States.</p>



<p>That is all see you next Sunday!</p>

<p>Russia and Turkey embody the early stages of the Disney Princesses from the movie Frozen, Anna and Elsa. In Frozen, Anna sings <em>Do You Want To Build A Snowman</em>, one lyric in this song is &#8216;we used to be best buddies, and now we&#8217;re not&#8217;. This refers to Russia and Turkey being very good trading partners but then President Erdogan of Turkey screaming at Russia and asking them to take a, &#8220;Big fat L.&#8221; As you can see, Russia and Turkey are no longer best buddies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized" datatext=""><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i.quotev.com/2hrkwbbrdxcq.jpg" alt="Encanto One-shots!" width="234" height="234"/></figure>



<p>The World Health Organization can be seen in Encanto&#8217;s Isabella. When you first look at both of them, you think that there is nothing that could go wrong with them, no drama, nothing. Although, if you look inside and find their true selves, you see that there is actually quite a lot of inner drama. For Isabella, it was the cacti and for the WHO, it was the claims of espionage and racism.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full" datatext=""><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="258" height="195" src="/ipd-archive/2022/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image-3.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-745"/></figure>



<p>The US is like Sleeping Beauty because when they were not paying attention, similar to when Aurora was sleeping, their kingdom was invaded by outsiders. In the US cabinet, that example would be the Russians but in Sleeping Beauty, it was the thorns that took over her kingdom as she slept for 100 years.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full" datatext=""><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="212" height="237" src="/ipd-archive/2022/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image-4.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-750"/></figure>



<p>Finally, China is like Moana because in the movie of Moana, the main character broke several rules as she left her home island of Motunui. In the same way, China has broken several treaties by making the decision to nuke many other countries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As working papers were being written on solutions for the distribution of covid vaccines, Turkey first joined Lebanon&#8217;s bloc VACC, which supported funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. After discovering their plans and perspective, they decided to switch and work with Israel in their bloc DDD (Distribution, Discipline, and Dedication).</p>



<p>An angered Lebanon confronted Turkey, outraged at Israel&#8217;s racism for not vaccinating Palestinians and questioned Turkey&#8217;s support.</p>



<p>Later, Senegal, one of the members of the DDD bloc, approached VACC to see if they could collaborate to make sure that the papers would pass, which they made very clear. However, on orders of Lebanon, Senegal was kicked out on allegations of spying.</p>



<p>Lebanon then spreads the conspiracy theory through the press that Israel was manipulating the situation to benefit themselves economically.</p>



<p>As many were now against Lebanon, a coalition was created to prevent Lebanon&#8217;s paper from passing, including DDD and other smaller blocs. However, this angered Lebanon once again; they decided to create fake messages involving Turkey spreading fake news to the press.</p>



<p>An anonymous statement was released saying &#8220;the VACC bloc has to make false posts and give false statements because they know that on their own, they won&#8217;t win. In the VACC paper, they talk lots about the importance of education and in being informed, but meanwhile, they feed conspiracy theories to other newspapers to try and undermine other papers.&#8221;</p>



<p>More to come as the story develops.</p>

<p>Two Belarusian refugees were welcomed by the Cabinet of Germany to share their emotional testimonies of immigration. They both seemed hopeless for the situation in Belarus and pleaded with the German Cabinet members to look at the immigration crisis more humanely. </p>



<p>“We are not statistics,” shares Marina Pikic. Marina shared that most of her life she has been a refugee and she has lost her homeland and family and friends because of the political turmoil in Bosnia; even with her migration to Germany she still struggles to get adequate health care and is food insecure.</p>



<p>Another refugee that accompanied Ms. Pikic was Mr. Saif Raza Azim. He shared that he lost his wife and daughter and was not upset at their enemy but how inhumanely the world treated refugees.</p>



<p>Th experience last night of listening to both Saif and Marina should be a reminder to the international community that refugees are people and that policy should be considered with caution and care. </p>



<p>Germany had the privilege of meeting with the two refugees one on one. Could this affect their future immigration policies in the future?</p>

<h2 id="the-original-issue-better-opportunities">The Original Issue/Better opportunities</h2>



<p>Starting from the being of the conference the PRC cabinet talked about working on their directives and by that they&#8217;ve managed to come up with a way to better their economy by not having funds to involve new housing development and working on the green energy plant.</p>



<p id="better-opportunities">Further on after the session the cabinet has managed to find a way to positively increase their representation to the media. From my interview with the minister of finance we talked about better <ins>china&#8217;s</ins> housing issue <ins>[</ins>from the housing bubbles<ins>]</ins> by providing funds and using the green energy they&#8217;ve been producing and assuring regards of the twitter leak of the U.S. file that china is making astounding progress and making sure<ins> that their nation stays strong. China also prides itself on making nuclear energy into positive energy, but from those outcomes china has also been working on their space stations and possible building up their current space station and</ins> have discussions on improving their resources for the area and the minister of finance has been working with companies for supply of the space station.</p>



<h3 id="early-conflicts">Early Conflicts</h3>



<p>From the meeting between the U.S. and China there was a very outraged dispute about whether both of their leaders dictatorship was valid and during the meeting the U.S. cabinet thinks they offered china a deal which the representative of trade offered &#8221; 10% of debt towards the U.S and we would want a allyship because we think it would be better for our economic structure and we don&#8217;t require a answer now. Shortly after the Chinese cabinet was outraged and thought &#8220;The deal was a hand held offer that benefited the U.S more than us,&#8221; the minister of finance said.</p>



<p>During the meeting the U.S. judged China&#8217;s dictatorship causing disruption and a outbreak of very hostile disputes and the PRC feels as they were disrespecting their president as the U.S. feel as they were &#8220;verbally abused&#8221; according to theSecretary of the U.S. when gotten to that point. President Biden also feels as they were the &#8220;most mature&#8221; party after his contributed outrage and feels as China was stepping out of line and the secretary of the U.S. feels as &#8220;China has completely overstepped their boundaries and has gone off the rails and they need us more than we need them.&#8221;</p>



<p>When talking to the PRC they stated that the deal  was &#8220;disgusting and disrespectful&#8221; and they will not need to take it upon them as they have bettered their economic value and have shown great leadership to helping with Bosnia and working with the Russian cabinet to help better funds, housing, military and etc.</p>



<h4 id="the-humiliation-of-the-ex-director-of-the-cia"><strong>The humiliation of the ex-Director of th</strong>e CIA</h4>



<p>Before the conference the CIA director asked me if I could spread information on the PRC and intentionally tried blackmailing me into giving information about the cabinet and later leaked documents from the U.S. cabinet personally to me as he told me to realize them and then blamed by fellow delegate BuzzFeed of releasing them. Later he told me that they accused china of sending cyber threats and planned to do the same back. He also asked me to mention this &#8220;We tried helping china for no other reason than ( We are nice) which was dumb. Then they decided to insult us when we went in the cabinet meeting and what did we get as a payback? Literally nothing.&#8221; He also stated that the U.S. was going to do a coup. </p>



<p>From the Twitter leak &#8220;the anonymous&#8221; source of the cabinet has held many closed sessions regarding the documents and after trying to send spies into the Chinese cabinet, persuading them and initially manipulating them, the PRC refused any discussion with him and other delegates.</p>



<p>Breaking news broke out that when he was found out for treason, leaked sensitive U.S. documents that have realized plans regarding many other cabinets.And so forth his failed attempts to not only the public, his cabinet and others have made him irresponsible delegate and some would say &#8220;crossing lines.&#8221; with his actions and responses as I can only imagine what his cabinet feels towards the betrayal of his actions. Further action has not been reported but he was fired from the position and arrested for treason of U.S. property.</p>



<h4 id="improvements-with-bosnia-and-social-ties">Improvements with Bosnia and Social ties</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized is-style-default" datatext=""><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQxZutsqrOjOp9Fkk8Hx2i4AjsMM9I0BY0ozA&amp;usqp=CAU" alt="" width="345" height="244"/></figure>



<p>The PRC and Russian cabinet have been in communion into helping Bosnian citizens and country and the Russian cabinet has made a warm-hearted comment as &#8220;Russia believes having a new republic will help for bettering Bosnia and gives a special thanks to China&#8217;s cabinet with helping with Bosnia&#8217;s economic issue,&#8221; Milorad Dodik said. Russia is also more than happy and would love to improve their ties with China and believes it would be better for social and economic value, as for Russia&#8217;s only goal is to help other countries and diminish their image of being a hardship country.</p>



<p>The PRC is proud to be a representative into making Bosnia a better country as for their media actions have proven and shown leadership for the smaller country. The cabinet has also using their new energy source (green energy) and has provided funds for Bonsai by sending 100¥ and has given military to them and assured that the money will be used responsibly and can only hope with this opportunity that the cabinet has given them that their economy will be improving rapidly!</p>

<div class="wp-block-image" datatext=""><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/ipd-archive/2022/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_7469-833x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-684" width="366" height="450" srcset="/ipd-archive/2022/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_7469-833x1024.jpg 833w, /2022/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_7469-244x300.jpg 244w, /2022/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_7469-768x944.jpg 768w, /2022/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_7469.jpg 1221w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" /><figcaption>Leaked US Intel on The War Situation</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Seoul has just fallen, and the future of a free Democratic Korea does not look bright. The army of the Democratic (ironically) People&#8217;s Republic of Korea continues to advance south and the USSR Air Force and Navy have moved in to support them. With the USSR Navy attempting to blockade the support being sent by the U.S. Navy to south Korea, while the USSR Air Force is fortifying the war front and establishing air superiority. The U.S. Army is making a desperate attempt to regain control of the situation, as can be seen by this update wired to the US Senate:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The United States has sent in an additional 65,000 troops to the Korean peninsula and is<br>attempting to recapture Seoul via conventional ground military and air strikes, which is where the<br>current military front is situated. The Soviet Union is attempting a blockade of the Korean peninsula<br>and has fired on American ships &#8212; the two navies are engaging in a large-scale naval battle. U.S.<br>troops look vulnerable as they have found themselves cut off from relief aid due to the Soviet blockade. The South Korean military continues to be unhelpful. China is still amassing troops on the Chinese-Korean border. The current situation for the American military is dire.</p></blockquote>



<p>            The United States hasn&#8217;t seen such dire straits since Pearl Harbor, and with the USSR Blocked, our troops are stranded in Korea, surrounded by enemies on all sides. The future does not look bright.</p>



<p>            But back at home, the situation isn&#8217;t much better, with the previously reported internal conflict becoming even more heated, with accusations flying in both the Senate and the Cabinet. In the Senate a bill was just passed, <strong>S.B. 17: Protecting Our Government’s Security; Unity and Happiness</strong>, which includes many extreme measures to root out hidden communists. Here are some excerpts:</p>



<ol><li><em>Hires outside private investigators to investigate all members of the United States government</em><ol><li><em>Investigators will investigate:</em><ol><li><em>Backgrounds</em></li><li><em>Personal lives</em></li><li><em>Beliefs</em></li><li><em>Ties to communist adversaries such as DPRK, USSR, etc</em></li></ol></li><li><em>Investigations will last around 2 weeks each, with the possibility of longer if the investigators deem it necessary</em></li></ol></li></ol>



<ol><li><em>Establishment of the Subversive Activities Control Board</em><ol><li><em>The creation of a governmental committee to investigate communist threats and sympathizers infiltrating our society and government</em><ol><li><em>Punishment of proven communists will be determined by the jury system</em></li><li><em>If found guilty, consequences range from fines to revoking of citizenship and deportation depending on amount of damage done&nbsp;</em></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol>



<p>            As one can see, the Senate is not messing around and may actually be able to root out many communists, but weather this will help the situation in Korea is yes to be seen. (Readers can view the entire bill attached at the bottom of this article) </p>



<p>            However, in the Cabinet things are heating up to a never before seen degree. In the middle of this crucial time of crisis. the Director of the FBI has accused the Ambassador to the USSR of being a <strong>hidden communist spy</strong>, with a document called the &#8220;Hoover Report&#8221;(attached below)! This accusation has torn the Cabinet apart in a time when they should be united. In light of this event, The New York Times reached out to multiple members of the Cabinet to get their statements on the issue. This is what they have to say:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-medium-font-size"><p>&#8220;I have recently been made aware of the “Hoover Report” which accuses me of communist affiliations. These accusations have been not just politically, but also personally difficult to come to terms with, after my sincerest efforts to fight against communism, as well as the working relationship I thought the Director of the FBI and myself shared. My fellow Americans, I promise you that I am a true patriot and a true believer in democracy. I have dedicated my life to this nation, serving with honor in WWI and WWII and now as an ambassador. As further detailed in my full statement, many of the claims laid against me are baseless and a complete manipulation of the facts. I have done nothing to harm this nation; I would never do anything to harm this nation, nor the ideals of freedom, liberty, and democracy. After the difficult situation in Korea, I believe that the Director of the FBI is perhaps attempting to use myself as a scapegoat. My fellow Americans: do not let fear of communism cloud your judgement. Do not let yourself be manipulated by an cunning, ambitious liar attempting to manipulate you and take down an innocent man.&#8221;</p><cite><strong>Statement from the accused themselves, the Ambassador to the USSR.</strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>              The full Official statement made by the Ambassador can be seen attached to the bottom of this article, singed by the Secretary of State, the Congressional Liaison, the Secretary of Press, and the Secretary of Defense. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-medium-font-size"><p>&#8220;While the Director of the FBI has accused the Ambassador to the USSR of being a communist, many of my fellow cabinet members including myself stand by the Ambassador as we believe the evidence the Director brings up is the result of misconstrued events and therefore we cannot accept his conclusion. However, I appreciate the Director&#8217;s vigilance and continued support of our nations fight against communism.&#8221;</p><cite><strong>Statement from the US Secretary of State</strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-medium-font-size"><p>&#8220;Personally, I take the side of the Ambassador. As we all know, she has served in wars before and has shown no intention of spreading communism. In fact, she has done quite the opposite. What is important to note is that by attacking the Ambassador to the USSR, the Director of the FBI is calling those who have worked with her communists as well. I do understand the point the Director of the FBI is coming from, as we all must remain aware of the public fear of communism. However, that does not mean that someone should make baseless accusations against a fellow American. These are trying times, and we must remember that we are one people. One body, even. God bless America.&#8221;</p><cite><strong>Statement from the Secretary of Defense.</strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Over the course of in an depth investigation on the actions of the Ambassador, the FBI finds this individual suspected of obstruction of government procedures as a result of potential motivation for personal or foreign gain. The FBI requires a further investigation at this time and will continue to report its findings. It is adamant that this is addressed immediately and swiftly due to the current situation in the Korean Peninsula.&#8221;</p><cite><strong>Statement on the accusations by the FBI Director themselves</strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>            As one can see, many seem to be on the side of the Ambassador to the USSR&#8217;s side, and there seems to be plenty of supporting evidence for this view. But only time will give us the whole truth. </p>



<p><strong>STAY TUNED.</strong>  </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Resolution 11, &#8220;A Resolution to Aid South Korea&#8217;s Defense,&#8221; just recently passed in the U.S. Senate sponsored by Sens. Kenneth McKellar (D-TN), James E. Murray]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Resolution 11, &#8220;A Resolution to Aid South Korea&#8217;s Defense,&#8221; just recently passed in the U.S. Senate sponsored by Sens. Kenneth McKellar (D-TN), James E. Murray (D-MT), Burnet R. Maybank (D-SC), and Ralph Flanders (R-VT).</p>



<p>South Korea seeks aid from the U.S. senators as they are far underprepared to protect South Korea&#8217;s sovereignty from the communist North Korean government. Resolution 11, while clearly expressing the United State&#8217;s intention of eradicating the spread of communism and the influence and power of the Soviet Union, looks to support South Korea as seen through its ten sections of the resolution.</p>



<p>As seen in Section 1: Authorization of Force, Section 2: Funding, Section 3: Establishment of MASH Medical Centers, and Section 6: Providing Humanitarian Aid to Refugees, the U.S Senators are working to support South Korea in eliminating escalation of communism in foreign countries.</p>



<p><strong>Section 1:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Authorization of Force</strong> states that the president is approved to deploy military forces to South Korea to prevent a North Korean invasion by establishing a base on the front line. As they are authorized to protect the sovereignty of South Korea, they will be permitted to utilize force when necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Section 2:</strong> <strong>Funding</strong> authorizes the United States to mobilize any excess funds deemed necessary and expendable to aid the efforts of the Republic of Korea Army. This section of the resolution encompasses initiatives such as creating an agency to investigate and make new weapons and tools to benefit their martial prowess, including possible organizations such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA. Funding for these initiatives may come from a mild increase in taxes as new jobs will be available, and wages will increase. It is also stated that the United States should attempt to lure in scientists from around the world with higher investments in the scientific sector in America. </p>



<p><strong>Section 3: Establishment of MASH Medical Centers</strong> is a sector requesting Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals that would remain neutral and protected by the Geneva convention. These hospitals would be staffed by officers of the U.S. Army and equipped to provide first aid to frontline patients received via helicopter or ambulance.</p>



<p><strong>Section 6:</strong> <strong>Providing Humanitarian Aid to Refugees</strong> involves Sen. Maybank&#8217;s refugee program, and the funding would be derived from Sen. Murray&#8217;s One Dollar initiative rather than from taxes. It is being requested that these refugee camps alongside hospitals and education centers be provided as soon as possible. Jobs and workplaces also need to be established for refugees as well as translators should be made easily accessible due to the language barrier. </p>



<p>The U.S. senators are providing as much as they can to guide South Korea, according to Sen. Murray.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Senate is doing stuff,&#8221; Sen. Murray said. &#8220;We are acting, there is bipartisan support, and we have sent all we can to Korea in order to aid their fight against the communist forces and it&#8217;s working! The releases by the New York Times and other press releases are incorrect in their characterization of this body as a bickering, inefficient body.&#8221; </p>



<p>The U.S. Senate has succeeded in taking action and is doing all that they can do to aid South Korea as they work to diminish the spread of the communist government.</p>

<p>I shall save the hot goss for last, so scroll down if you don&#8217;t care about the &#8220;boring stuff,&#8221; and just want to know which two countries are duking it out in the World Health Organization right now. </p>



<h2 id="the-triple-d-resolution">The Triple D Resolution</h2>



<p>I first spoke with the WHO delegate of Trinidad and Tobago about the Distribution, Discipline and Dedication, Triple D, or DDD, resolution underway at the WHO. The goal of the resolution is to create equality in vaccine distribution. </p>



<p>The goals of the resolution: </p>



<ul><li>Attempts to build huge facilities in each major region of the world. </li><li>Partnership between the WHO and Doctors Without Borders (bringing more doctors to underdeveloped nations) </li><li>Educating citizens: creating an easy-to-use educational page on the WHO website and utilizing social media </li><li>Creating a partnership between countries with low vaccination rates (under 75%) and countries with high vaccination rates </li></ul>



<p>The initiative will be primarily funded by the People&#8217;s Republic of China, as well as the World Bank, New Zealand and Israel. The delegate of Trinidad and Tobago informed me that they will also be seeking funding from private and governmental institutions across the world. Let&#8217;s place bets on whether or not the USA will get involved. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Our greatest focus with this initiative is the partnering of underdeveloped countries with countries that have high vaccination rates.&#8221;</p><cite>WHO Delegate of Trinidad and Tobago</cite></blockquote>



<p>First world countries with high vaccination rates are expected to manufacture and provide vaccines for their developing counterpart, providing education to the developing country, helping to create vaccine facilities within their developing partner, among other initiatives. The delegate of Trinidad and Tobago cited Israel, and Trinidad and Tobago, as an exemplar partnership due to the surplus of vaccines within Israel and the potential for sharing them with Trinidad and Tobago. </p>



<h2 id="underdeveloped-countries-for-equitable-vaccine-distribution-by-nigeria-kenya-and-paraguay">Underdeveloped Countries for Equitable Vaccine Distribution by Nigeria, Kenya and Paraguay</h2>



<p>The WHO delegate of Paraguay reached out to me for an interview at the very beginning of todays (February 5th) sessions, in order to discuss a paper which their team is currently working on, the <em>Underdeveloped Countries for Equitable Vaccine Distribution </em>paper. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Our paper focuses specifically on underdeveloped countries. I think this really sets us apart from everyone else. Everyone else that we have heard from is talking about the major world powers, and all of their donations, but no one is acknowledging the fact that developing countries have different needs than those of developed countries when it comes to equitable and sustainable vaccine distribution.&#8221; </p><cite>WHO Delegate of Paraguay </cite></blockquote>



<p>The delegate is disgusted by the fact that developing countries are fully reliant on &#8220;handouts&#8221; for the time being, as they lack the resources to develop their own vaccines and facilities. She explained that most developing countries have been forced to survive off of the hand me downs of more powerful countries, being given vaccines which have almost expired or have already expired. The delegate cited a lack of effective and/or safe storage procedures in developing countries as one of the main reasons for vaccine waste in developing countries. </p>



<p>Nigeria, Kenya and Paraguay have joined forces in order to confront these challenges. The team intends to partner with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the building of vaccine manufacturing facilities in the Global South: establishing a dependable source for vaccine manufacturing and creating jobs in developing countries. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really look at it (the financial involvement of the Gates Foundation) as a handout. I look at it as an investment.&#8221; </p><cite>WHO Delegate of Paraguay</cite></blockquote>



<p>The declaration of the UCEVD as an investment is especially exciting to me, as the infrastructure established by this agreement will, no doubt, continue to serve developing countries in new ways if we are to ever face another Global Health Crisis. The delegate of Trinidad and Tobago is to act as a signatory for the initiative. </p>



<h2 id="drama-in-the-world-health-organization-the-hot-goss-if-you-will">Drama in the World Health Organization (The hot goss, if you will)</h2>



<p>Now is the time for the piping hot tea. An anonymous source has informed me that in WHO meetings, Israel and Lebanon are incessantly butting heads. The source is a member of the World Health Organization, and therefore has access to all WHO committee sessions and has witnessed the behavior first hand. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Israel and Lebanon refuse to work together due to political clashes involving vaccinating Palestinians.&#8221; </p><cite>Anonymous WHO Delegate </cite></blockquote>



<p>In addition to the tensions rising between Israel and Lebanon, there has been increased tension between Delegates of the World Health Organization and the Chair. The chair has, allegedly, stated that sponsors for both the Triple D Resolution and the Underdeveloped Countries for Equitable Vaccine Distribution Initiative <strong><em>must </em></strong>be of the &#8220;economically sound, more developed countries.&#8221; The anonymous WHO delegate informed me that this puts many delegates&#8217; papers at risk, and is therefore hurting the underdeveloped countries which could use the support. WHO delegates are upset by these restrictions, and tensions only continue to grow. </p>



<p>Although, on a more positive note, my anonymous source alleges that sparks are FLYING between the WHO delegates of Cuba and Israel, as Israel uses the dynamic to her advantage: manipulating the UCEVD to the favor of their signatories. </p>

<p>I had the privilege to have one-on-one interviews with the minister of education in Turkey and the minister of social services. From both interviews I was able to learn how the refugee crisis in Syria and other countries has hurt Turkey’s services to its citizens. Though there has been directives that have helped with this crisis it is important to recognize how the EU has created this burden on Turkey. <br></p>



<p>Sunday Times: Why has Turkey added to directives clauses on refugee education?<br>Minister of Education: In countries like Syria that have a big outflow of refugees, the majority of the refugees have migrated to neighboring nations specifically Turkey. Disappointingly, many families are traveling to Turkey, which has hurt social services in Turkey because of the number of people who are now utilizing these services. Turkey is a small country though powerful and does not have the infrastructure to support these people.</p>



<p>Sunday Times: How has Turkey’s relationship with the EU affected the refugee crisis?</p>



<p>Minister of Education: The European Union is very stingy with the number of refugees they allow into their borders. They havent helped much in terms of relief or allowing people into their nations to take the burden off Turkey. </p>



<p>Sunday Times: I&#8217;m sorry to hear that! How has COVID affected the number of refugees Turkey has seen? </p>



<p>Minister of Education: Due to COVID, Turkey has been forced to close their borders a few times, which has caused the number of refugees to decrease. However, COVID has made the means of immigration more unsafe. Most refugees are not vaccinated against COVID or potentially bring it with them. Refugee sites specifically have had high number of COVID cases. </p>



<p>Sunday Times: What are solutions Turkey has been focusing on with the refugee crisis?</p>



<p>Minister of Social Services: Turkey has worked on directives that increase social service access to refugees and increased the budget for these services.</p>



<p>Sunday Times: Good to hear there have been strides hopefully other countries step up to help with this crisis!</p>



<p>Update:</p>



<p>Turkey&#8217;s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Germany&#8217;s Minister of foreign affairs organized a meeting between the two nations to discuss refugee issues. Turkey ends up upset with the indifferent of reaction of Germany. The cabinet of Germany believes the EU and themselves have done enough to aid the crisis. Both countries leave unhappy.</p>
