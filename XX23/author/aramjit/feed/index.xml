<p>During the latest press conference, a representative from the cabinet of the People&#8217;s Republic of China spoke out about the war still happening between China and India.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not that long ago, the Indian communications minster threatened me at a press conference. He said to me: &#8216;Do you want war? Do you want war? Minister you have your war,'&#8221; the representative from China said. </p>



<p>&#8220;China&#8217;s military position is strong. Our offense and defense are firm and unwavering. Despite this strong position and our previous experience with radical Indian cabinet, China will once again graciously offer the diplomatic solution.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;Firstly, an immediate removal of all Indian troops from rightfully Chinese territory,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Second, economic reparations for all the damages India has caused China. Third, India&#8217;s support for China becoming a full member of the United Nation&#8217;s General Assembly. Fourth, India returning all seized territory that are rightfully Chinese. China is choosing to fight fire with diplomacy. We want this war to end, but if India wants to worsen this conflict and let more innocent Chinese and Indian civilians die, China&#8217;s hands are tied.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ald. Reilly, 42nd, spoke out about breaking news following the passed ordinances and the achievements that the Chicago City Council have accomplished during their committee sessions. </p>



<p>&#8220;The government is actually passing ordinances. We&#8217;ve had a variety of topics from addressing the migrant housing and homelessness, address city cleanliness that we all know metropolitan areas desperately needs, we&#8217;ve also addressed municipal marketing and even something about the Chicago Bears. We are now addressing topics about health care, guns and public safety.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;All of these issues, which have been on topic vote for so long have been brought towards with collaboration between myself and other Ald. Additionally, we have made progress on other pressing national issues that have a relationship with the community. We have put old geriences aside and put needs to our constitutions first as our governments should.&#8221; </p>

<p>Alds. Sigcho-Lopez, Gardiner, Villegas, Sposato, Reilly and Vasquez from the Chicago City Council have now formally passed an ordinance known as FAM or Federal Aid to Migrants emphasizing the importance of housing for migrants to Chicago and suggesting community involvement and support.</p>



<p>Previously, there have been debates on what topic should be discussed during committee and after consideration and voting, topic 3 municipal marketing has been chosen. In the passed ordinance, they deeply described how pushing for migrant work visas in sanctuary cities, citizen involvement, federal intervention and access to safe temporary housing is important.</p>



<p> &#8220;The FAM plan is mainly for pushing the youth to have a more supporting environment in Chicago and especially making sure the next generation doesn&#8217;t have the same struggles as the ones that just migrated. We&#8217;re putting a heavy focus on real estate and abandoned buildings,&#8221; Ald. Sigcho-Lopez, 25th, stated in an interview regarding the FAM paper.</p>

<p>Following late night meetings to address tension along the Sino-Indian border, the People&#8217;s Republic of China among others spoke out to the press addressing topics that are occurring at the moment.</p>



<p>&#8220;China has met with India before to find the diplomatic solution to our bordering conflict,&#8221; said the representative from the People&#8217;s Republic of China. &#8220;India refuses to engage. China dropped the subject and left India alone, focusing on its internal affairs.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There was peace at the border until India murdered innocent Chinese citizens,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;China will not be complacent in the face of this attack. China has a plan for conflict ahead, one that will be executed with utmost precision. To the Chinese people, the coming days will be trying but we must stay united. Trust in China. You are about to feel the full power and fury of the People&#8217;s Liberation Army.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>2 full committee sessions done. 5 different blocs, 5 different focused problems, 4 different working papers and 1 passed ordinance. There has been a lot of debate on whether the aldermen of the Chicago City Council should focus on the migrants coming into the state or the Chicagoans that are already there. Their solution? Combine. </p>



<p>During the past committee session, the council, specifically Ald. Dowell, 3rd, Ald. Lee, 11th, Ald. Reilly, 42nd, and Ald. Sigcho-Lopez, 25th, passed a Short-term Migrant Solution (SMS) paper recognizing that there are many abandoned buildings that should be able to be used for the sake of housing migrants. The passed paper also recognizes workers that are needed to support the migrant shelters and acknowledges the necessity of providing proper funding. </p>



<p> &#8220;There are many school buildings that are abandoned which are in perfectly working condition but haven&#8217;t been used,&#8221; Ald. Lee, one of the ordinance sponsors, said. &#8220;We need to clean up, turn on the heating and air, etc. We hope to turn them into temporary shelters for migrants and homeless people in our city.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Similarly there are other people in working on public safety and municipal marketing,&#8221; Ald. Lee said. &#8220;Essentially, our council is able to do as many topics as we wish. I believe multitasking and combining the paper is working well for our committee.&#8221; </p>



<p>Even though this paper has passed, the council is now working on another paper similar to the first but mainly focused on topic 3, municipal marketing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Climate change has been a long-lived issue of the global community. As the world&#8217;s economies develop, climate change has only advanced. The effects of climate change are more visible than ever before with an increase in tropical storms, droughts, forest fires, and the acceleration of rising sea levels. It is now accepted that the only possible way to combat climate change is through a multifaceted approach of reduced emissions, carbon capture, carbon offset, and many more.</p>



<p>According to a delegate in the UN General Assembly, “China is currently working on achieving those goals of sustainability, and is on a good track to do so. Carbon emissions should peak by 2025, five years ahead of the original goal, 2030. China is achieving these goals by increasing solar and wind power generation capacity by 500  gigawatts, creating and investing in further electric vehicles, focusing on energy use in irrigation and establishing a quality emissions counting system for corporate companies. China is solving this climate crisis in a fast and efficient way.”</p>



<p>China produces about 30 percent of total emissions, more than the United States, the European Union and India combined, according to Global Carbon Budget 2022. China’s emissions grew by 10 percent year-on-year during the second quarter of this year – putting it on course to beat its previous record of 11.47 billion metric tonnes in 2021, according to data compiled by Carbon Brief, a United Kingdom-based website focused on climate policy.</p>



<p>“China will continue working towards these goals, and is going to continue to push to find safe alternatives to fossil fuels, and to implement further regulations on the matter. China is also looking into purchasing an area of land, such as the national parks in the United states, to reserve to combat any carbon dioxide emissions. In the future, China suggests other countries follow their lead. China would be pleased to aid any countries, particularly underdeveloped countries, that are also fighting for a cleaner world.”</p>
