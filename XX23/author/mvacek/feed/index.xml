<p>Though the unfortunate crisis involving the U.S. and USSR in Cuba has raised tensions and concerns of war, there are also many American domestic concerns that could be revolutionary in women&#8217;s rights. The war effort is supported by women which is reflected by the growing number of women in the workplace aiding in war efforts. Not only does this benefit the factory industry and war production, but also boosts the domestic economy, advancing and building the nation. As for opportunities for women, the current crisis has been evidenced in women&#8217;s abilities and aspirations. </p>



<p>The press representative for the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women commented saying, &#8220;Additionally, our commission has been working towards creating legislative reforms that focus on educational opportunities&#8230;to ensure that these women are starting off with the right skill set.&#8221; </p>



<p>Women will have opportunities to be business owners and entrepreneurs unlike ever before. This crisis has brought on the guarantee of women in the workplace and to have equal freedoms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After the early morning crisis update of the war starting on the border, the side is at fault is still in question. The previous status of peace between India and China on the border dispute seems to be a stand-still, as both parties claim contrasting perspectives. It has been on record that the two nations appeared to be coming to terms and possibly end the dispute once and for all, up until the yesterday&#8217;s press conference where a press representative for each the China cabinet and Indian Council shared the conflicting accounts of the relations.</p>



<p>Yesterday, the Indian council made it known during the press conference that they intend not to move on the border and has claimed in the past that expanding borders is not in their interests either. At a press release in the Council yesterday , the Director of Intelligence commented on the matter describing how the Chinese government have been negligent of their offers of diplomatic relations, furthermore the Chinese are the aggressors in this conflict. According to the council, China has been violent and have killed many Indian citizens on the border. </p>



<p>At the very same press conference yesterday evening, the press representative for the People&#8217;s Republic of China stated, &#8220;India, wrongly claiming Chinese territory as its own has blatantly denied every Chinese attempt at reconciliation. China does not want violence. It wants the people of China to be safe, protected, and well fed, but Nehru has refused a trade deal, reused collaboration on scientific endeavors, refused to engage on our shared ties of decolonization.&#8221; All the while, China was also occupied with internal struggles and growth as they try to recover from the tragic event of the Banqiao Dam collapsing and crude accusations of being involved in the disappearance of the beloved Dalai Lama.</p>



<p>Now with the ongoing hostilities and violence between the two it begs the question; &#8220;Who is the real aggressor?&#8221; Both parties claim war is not wanted and have the similar resolution method of communication if the other party is willing. The issue of disinformation being spread threatened the situation and rose tensions, undoubtedly leading us to where we are today in the dispute. Going forward, it seems tensions are only rising and the two Asian nations are on the brink of war. More on this ongoing conflict coming soon in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In recent updates there have been news of Indian guerrilla fighters at the border with China in response to the growing India and China border conflict. Guerrilla fighters may include armed civilians and non-professional paramilitary groups, even children.</p>



<p>Although the council claimed that safety of their people was the biggest concern, these fighters at the high risk Indian border raise many concerns about this. This also brings into question the preparedness of the nation as the border troops are not high-ranking military but civilians who are not trained and are at high risk facing the strong Chinese army.</p>



<p>In today&#8217;s press conference, the Indian Minister of Communications responded claiming, &#8220;&#8230;in our last press conference we did mention that we were confident in winning this war and that we believed we had the military strength to really support it.&#8221; This claim seems to falsify their reinforcing statement on the safety of Indian citizens as their &#8220;military strength&#8221; is made up of untrained citizens and possibly children, and ultimately contrasts the recent developments.</p>

<p>After the recent update of hostilities and tensions rising between China and India at the border, it calls into question the next step taken by India after their numerous &#8220;attempts at communication and peace.&#8221; After press observation in the Indian Council it has become clear that cabinet members are looking for strategies and a plan of action on the war front. Members have collectively agreed on contacting the United States for foreign aid. </p>



<p>When questioned about India&#8217;s economic stability and dangers of entering war at a recent press conference, the Minister of Communications and press representative seemed to be confident in India&#8217;s ability to enter war if needed and asserted that Indian citizens should not worry about funding the war. If U.S. involvement were to occur it would be on the precedent of India&#8217;s welcoming global relations and would be beneficial to the country that &#8220;only got its independence 15 years ago.&#8221; Only time will tell if India&#8217;s confidence in their economic strength holds up as they claim it will.</p>

<p>The largest dam collapse to date has just occurred, killing thousands. The Banqiao Dam&#8217;s failure was not only a hit to the citizens of PR China, but to the economic stability and development as well. However, through perseverance, China stands tall in the face of disaster. The People&#8217;s Republic of China press conference representative shared the nation&#8217;s quick action and careful steps to mitigate the catastrophic outcomes, &#8220;We have created a civilian relief organization headed by the Minister of Public Security to fill home up again. To provide food and water, to educate the affected children, China is coming together in a crisis to help its own.&#8221; The new age of China still stands strong in their goals of self growth, this crisis only proving China&#8217;s internal strength and union.</p>

<p>The US cabinet sought to reassure the American people concerned about Cuba and the missile crisis with a statement to the press. &#8220;[The American people] have nothing to worry about,&#8221; the Head of Publicity said. &#8220;They are just building them in Cuba, and we are currently working on perusing a diplomatic solution with the USSR. Which would get these nuclear weapons out of Cuba and stop the construction of these launch sites.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Kennedy Administration and cabinet acknowledge the worries and stress by the American people with the rumors at hand, but have made it clear that conflicts are under control as they actively pursue solutions with the USSR. No other comment has been made about further actions and relations with the USSR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recent development in the border dispute between India and People&#8217;s Republic of China seems to be making its way to resolution and some harmony between the countries. Ministers of the People&#8217;s Republic of China have opened up on their desire for sanctity and peace with India in terms of the conflict. They have also been speaking about their motivations to build longer ties with foreign nations in general.</p>



<p>The violent border dispute has led to the unfortunate loss of around 1,300 Chinese lives, always keeping China on the defense. However, developments show an inclination by China for outreach to India on the matter with optimistic perspectives. Agreement with peace is driven to be made with India through varied forms of cooperation such as trade or research developments. The Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs claims, &#8220;China obviously strives in order to emphasize the importance of communication, and in doing so China hopes to reach out with India in order to promote peace at the Border.&#8221; This attempt at an agreement is forthcoming, yet still in the works as updates have shown. Despite the fluctuating history between China and India, this may be hopeful for the two nations&#8217; futures.</p>



<p>Not only is mutuality with India in the focus of this cabinet but also other foreign affairs and allies with other Asian nations. PRC desires to mitigate their isolationist ways by industrializing and potentially uniting with other nations to have a mutual respect and spread their socialist idealism. The PRC&#8217;s Head of Publicity Department spoke to this topic: &#8220;In a new and open and growing China we need to be open to partners no matter where they come from because ultimately we all share the ultimate goal of socialism, of liberation for the people, for the workers, and simply put the happiness of every citizen.&#8221; China&#8217;s initiative for a new age of growth and global connections is an opportunity for many other nations as well as for China and self-development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Foreign aggression is a concerning issue today in the U.S. and bolstering American influence is a topic of exigence brought to the attention of the U.S. cabinet. The abiding consequences of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War has led to fluctuation in the U.S. economy which concerns itself as an issue in the long term. The U.S. cabinet will take on this matter for possible resolution to ongoing conflicts affecting the economy and U.S. influence.</p>



<p>Treasury secretary Janet Yellen plays an influential financial role in the direct control of U.S. monetary policy. “When it comes to foreign conflicts, I firmly believe in continued U.S. financial support of Ukraine against Russian aggression,&#8221; Yellen said. &#8220;However, this comes with many risks and I plan on implementing significant regulation and protocols in order to prevent abuse of this emerging sector.” </p>



<p>With the issue at hand, Yellen plays a key role in the resolution of this international conflict, and who desires peace that potentially invokes advancements in the U.S. to a higher technologically advanced position within the international community.</p>



<p>As a whole the cabinet strives to achieve democracy and personal freedom as an outcome of this resolution. While Yellen could not comment on everything the cabinet may or may not do, she directs that there is a clear focus on economic support towards Ukraine and does not have military-related plans against Russia. Momentary outcomes would be not to pursue trade aggression with foreign adversaries such as China and look inward to adjust American government agencies as well as modify tax policy in order to raise revenue for our future plans. Ideally as a long term resolution they want to come out of this with peace both foreign and domestically, provide Americans with a bright future and strengthen their personal wealth as well as promote innovation and American private enterprise.</p>
