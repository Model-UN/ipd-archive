										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>X Corporation, owner of the social media platform formerly known as Twitter and currently developing X-Connect, is currently being sued by the U.S. government. They say they have nothing to hide, but, if they have nothing to hide, what is the real reason for them getting sued? The X representative said that they have not had government involvement because of the issues that are surrounded with it, but they are not involved and are having issues with that same government. </p>



<p>They say that they are still committed to the development of the X-Connect app while following regulations and focusing on innovations even after this information of them being sued. After a U.S. cabinet meeting in which an A.I. implication was brought up, the U.S. government and X each threatened to sue the other entity. So they say that they have no government relations, yet still talk to the U.S. cabinet? That is directly going against what the X representative said they were doing. How are you able to go against your own words?</p>



<p>Even though they are receiving an abundance of backlash and are in the midst of getting sued, X Corporation is still attempting to further develop their app. Which also raises the question, will that affect the amount of users that will use their X-Connect app? They have said that they are going to continue to control their app because they have trust in their own systems, and as of now have no further comment on the situation.</p>

<p>In the midst of China&#8217;s election crisis, Tencent has confirmed that they have no stance on current political issues. While expressing regret for the civil unrest, they have unequivocally disclaimed that they are not at all involved with the election. However, they are actively engaged with exciting new developments as they announced &#8220;Link&#8221; at the latest press conference. Similar to X-Connect, Link is also a so-called &#8220;everything app,&#8221; allowing users to access multiple services through one cohesive program. Tencent describes unique features such as consumer subscription, benefits including points and reward systems, and integrated access to companies. Delegates should be looking out for what Tencent will present next!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Following the KMT and DDP disputes that erupted within Taiwan over the legitimacy of the nation&#8217;s presidential election, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit against social networking corporation X, on the grounds of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 is a United States antitrust law with statutes developed by governments to protect consumers from predatory business practices and ensure fair competition.</p>



<p>X, in defense of it&#8217;s name and absolutely appalled by the accusations against the corporation, has successfully launched a countersuit against the DOJ. The verdict of this countersuit is undoubtedly one to track over the coming days as developments arise.</p>

<p>Elon Musk has made his decision. At approximately 9:15pm on Dec. 8, 2023, X saw two of its board members promptly resign upon the announcement of Mr. Musk possibly taking members off the board himself. These members were the Director of Marketing and Director of Operations, and upon their resignation they donated all of their stocks to the charity foundations backed by Elon Musk. In their replacement, the X corporate board added a Director of Investments in addition to a Department Chair of IT. </p>



<p>Furthermore, rival company Tencent has gained 10% of X&#8217;s shares in a previous transaction with Vanguard, an investment management company. Due to Tencent holding at least a 10% share within the corporation, they have earned themselves a seat at the table of X&#8217;s corporate board, one with the additional right to cast votes that can held guide the course in which things go for the corporation</p>



<p>Now, X struggles yet again with internal issues that could prove detrimental to the security of the board as an American corporation as well as users of X and X-Connect.</p>

<p>Earlier today, the Washington Post received an anonymous tip on a member of the board planning to use legal loopholes in order to expedite user data to foreign nations such as China. This has now erupted into an all out finger-pointing war within the corporate board room. Only time will tell what happens next as Elon Musk himself comments that he will take it upon himself to decide the fate of the board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>X, previously known as Twitter, is now providing the world with more updates. Elon Musk took over the app and has re-named it X, but as the X representative explained, there is a new update to the app, and it is now called, X Connect. The X representative has announced the first round of beta testing that X and that the app is now accessible is many countries across the world. </p>



<p>The X representative stated how, “X AI is used to flag false information.” There are opposing view on this opinion stated by the X representative by the U.S.A. representative. While X is saying that false information will be flagged, the U.S.A. is warning others to watch what they post on X. </p>



<p>X representative said, “X maps is something that we have never seen before.” Yet, most mobile phones, whether Apple, Samsung, or Google, have some sort of maps app. So why is implementing a map setting into an app on a phone that already has a map built in? It is nothing that we have not already seen before. </p>



<p>“Our goal is to create an easy use for the user,” X representative shared. Yet the X Connect app is only slightly the same as the original Twitter app that was used before the purchase from Elon Musk. The new features are just getting father off from the original app that everyone did love. </p>



<p>The new X Connect app that is being proposed is using AI technology within the app, which has already been discussed negatively by a large population of the public. There have also been some new proposed features that are taking away from the social media aspect of the app, which would seem to take away from the connect aspect of the app that the X representative tried make everyone aware of. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Social network company X (formerly known as Twitter) has recently announced its transition from solely social media into an &#8220;everything app.&#8221; Everything apps, also called &#8220;super apps,&#8221; are mobile apps that can handle many aspects of digital life. These aspects include but are not limited to: direct messaging, video calls, location sharing, mobile payments, online shopping, games, online banking, and delivery services. </p>



<p>In an closed door interview with the Washington Post, X Director of Human Resources and Chair of Legal Department released specifics on some of the new features coming to the platform. These features will all be contained within a new app called X-Connect. It should be noticed that this will separate the parent company X from the daughter everything app that will be X-Connect, a situation similar to that of Uber and UberEats. Some of the features that can be expected to be found on X-Connect are an in-app browser extension, a professional business social network, an in-app streaming platform, and an artificial intelligence (A.I.) assistant.</p>



<p>Moreover, during a press conference Thursday, X Director of Public Relations made the promise that X will be the app that connects us all, in addition that &#8220;[X] will be the app that everyone has and everyone uses&#8221;. If the features that the company plans to release can successfully connect with its intended global audience, X&#8217;s aspirations may not be as unobtainable as they may seem.</p>

<p>We will handle these fake allegations with grace and efficiency. X as a company prides ourselves as upstanding and lawful. The accusations made against our Chair of Legal Department along with the blatant attack on X-connect are excessive. We are not unlawful and our business never violated U.S. policy.</p>

<p>Social media platform X, formerly Twitter, is now looking to implement some further changes discussed in a press conference Thursday. </p>



<p>A representative from X spoke lightly on the situation, “We will be adding additional features,” that a representative from X said “will completely change social media.” Those new possible features were not disclosed at the time of the conference. </p>



<p>“It is something that we have never seen in our other competitors,” the X representative further explained. Further showing how they are sharing that there will be change, but more has to come with it. The team members of X want to see further connection within people on the app, and also want to change the “app game.” They want to keep misinformation out and further discuss within themselves before adding more change, which is also being discussed with the United States. </p>



<p>In October 2022, multibillionaire Elon Musk took over the Twitter app, then renaming it X. Musk paid $44 million dollars to buy X, intending to make a social media platform that allows freedom of speech around the globe. The most visible change that has been implemented to the app has been the switch from the blue bird logo and Twitter name to the switch to the black and white X logo. </p>
