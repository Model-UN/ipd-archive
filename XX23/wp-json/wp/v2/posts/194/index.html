These aspects include but are not limited to: direct messaging, video calls, location sharing, mobile payments, online shopping, games, online banking, and delivery services. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an closed door interview with the Washington Post, X Director of Human Resources and Chair of Legal Department released specifics on some of the new features coming to the platform. These features will all be contained within a new app called X-Connect. It should be noticed that this will separate the parent company X from the daughter everything app that will be X-Connect, a situation similar to that of Uber and UberEats. Some of the features that can be expected to be found on X-Connect are an in-app browser extension, a professional business social network, an in-app streaming platform, and an artificial intelligence (A.I.) assistant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, during a press conference Thursday, X Director of Public Relations made the promise that X will be the app that connects us all, in addition that &#8220;[X] will be the app that everyone has and everyone uses&#8221;. If the features that the company plans to release can successfully connect with its intended global audience, X&#8217;s aspirations may not be as unobtainable as they may seem.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Social network company X (formerly known as Twitter) has recently announced its transition from solely social media into an &#8220;everything app.&#8221; Everything apps, also called<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8,"featured_media":300,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[34,12],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/194"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=194"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/194\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":333,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/194\/revisions\/333"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/300"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=194"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=194"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=194"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
