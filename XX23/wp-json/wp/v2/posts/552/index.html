In a sense, China seeks to pour more funding into preventing additional conflict between the nations, rather than simply supplying the band-aids to heal those affected by it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>China expressed to the Post directly that it was actually disappointed in the direction that the UNSC has been moving in and that &#8220;the lack of action from the Security Council to even issue a statement requesting peace talks is honesty a tragedy in and of itself and reflects extremely poorly upon the UNSC, especially when aid packages have already been sent before.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On the morning of Dec. 9, 2023, The Times of India published a piece on China recently using it&#8217;s veto power within the United Nations<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8,"featured_media":579,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[6],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/552"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=552"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/552\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":646,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/552\/revisions\/646"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/579"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=552"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=552"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=552"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
