The cabinet started with suggestions for pressuring China with the situation in Taiwan, and the proposal of possible sanctions which the UNSC is open to was discussed.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. cabinet currently already has ships in Japan for a diplomatic presence in the region, moving forward with sanctions they feel will be the most effective way Additionally, they feel that these harder sanctions will pressure China about their wrongdoings and have more international pressure about correcting their wrongs.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The representative from the UNSC had advised that there is a firm reason for these sanctions on China, and that the body does whatever they can in significance with their cause, supporting Taiwan.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later on, in the press conference, the United States cabinet, madam Press Secretary had explained that the United States was shocked by China\u2019s reaction to the call for a revote. The U.S. has time and time again reached out to the PRC yet has received no response, but the PRC was reported to barge into the U.S. cabinet&#8217;s closed session when it was \u201cmost convenient for them.\u201d China\u2019s sudden aggression within Taiwan now gives the U.S. reason to believe that there is heavy Chinese involvement, as their own social media platform, Tencent has also been explicitly spreading disinformation that directly influenced the results of the election.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cabinet has also called upon the UNSC to help with the current issues within Taiwan, specifically the corruption seen within the election and the democracy impeded from within it. Additionally, they have coordinated asking for how the UNSC will choose to move forward with China\u2019s actions as the U.S. government specifically will no longer be contacting the Chinese government due to the \u201cdisrespect of sanctity diplomacy.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An intercepted source has also let us know that China is threatening the U.S. and threatening to get rid of some things that are unknown in regard to the U.S. The U.S. economy also is thriving and has no further need for China.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, in an interview with UN Ambassador Linda Thomas Greenfield, \u201cThe U.S. is trying their best in order to help Taiwan as the United States has empathy for all and they are heavily focused on the economy to help our citizens. Alongside this, we are arranging a meeting with the U.S. delegation from the Security Council as their input is valuable.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The response from the UNSC is still being awaited and more developments will continue as debate on the next steps to be taken continue.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The U.S. cabinet had recently called upon a representative from the UN Security Council regarding the matter involving Taiwan.
