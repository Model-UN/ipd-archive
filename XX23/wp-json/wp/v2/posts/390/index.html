However, Democratic Senator Olin. D. Johnston believes that in doing so, the government on several occasions has infringed the rights of individual states and their constitutional ability to create laws the reflect the views of their people. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why he, alongside other conservative democrats from the south, have drafted the Declaration on States Rights and Constitutional Principals, also known as the &#8220;Second Southern Manifesto&#8221;. This  manifesto stresses the importance of recognizing how badly state sovereignty has been disrespected within the United States. Additionally, Senator Johnston himself states that &#8220;The recent advocacy for legislation targeted towards civil rights is &#8216;Un-American&#8217; and as unwarranted as it is unconstitutional.&#8221; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Over the past few years, the United States government has made significant pushes in the direction of improved civil rights and breaking down gender-based disparities.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8,"featured_media":399,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[16],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/390"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=390"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/390\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":427,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/390\/revisions\/427"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/399"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=390"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=390"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=390"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
