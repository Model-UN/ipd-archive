It was supposed to help the millions of civilians living in distress, which now seems a hard goal to reach.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The United States has had very strong opinions regarding this situation as they do not support the use of the veto. The United States is against China\u2019s veto in the humanitarian aid paper as there was perhaps no true basis for China to use its powers. It is also important to note that this humanitarian aid paper was supported by the Russian Federation.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an interview with the United States, they expressed their deep disappointment, saying, \u201chumanitarian aid was crucial, and support for both eastern and western powers was on this paper.
