The consequences of this were the fact that the people regretted their decision and this is causing violent riots within Taiwan. The U.S. continued to investigate this matter further. Simultaneously, the People&#8217;s Republic of China made statements saying how they are all for democracy, and democracy has spoken. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This caused quite a stir within U.S. government, as there were talks of impeachment from the Republican party as they felt no proper measures were being taken.
