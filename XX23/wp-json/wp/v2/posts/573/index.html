The post-Senate meeting interview with Jessica Weis and Dr. Henry David shed light on the Senate&#8217;s acknowledgment of their concerns, particularly regarding Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson&#8217;s letter. Weis added her perspective, saying, &#8220;The questions that they posed were very good. And I&#8217;m very happy that they mentioned that they passed a bill that brought up women and protections for them.&#8221; Despite the challenges, there seems to be a newfound dialogue between the PCSW and the Senate, hinting at the possibility of improved collaboration. The committee members expressed satisfaction with the Senate&#8217;s responsiveness and hoped for improved communication on resolutions and bills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the cabinet meeting, Marguerite Rawalt and Honorable John Macy, Jr. highlighted the positive strides made in addressing issues related to women&#8217;s roles in the military and workforce. They emphasized the importance of promoting women&#8217;s contributions, especially in times of crisis such as the Cuban Missile Crisis. The committee members remained professional, advocating for women&#8217;s relevance to national security without succumbing to individual anger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the committee&#8217;s optimism was tempered by a press conference where U.S. Cabinet representative John McCone claimed that the status of women was a low priority amid the pressing matters facing the government. The official asserted, &#8220;As we have a lot going right now, the status of women is at a low priority at the moment.&#8221; This disappointing declaration underscored the uphill battle the PCSW faces in securing recognition for women&#8217;s issues in the current political climate. The committee questions how America could be a powerhouse if women were marginalized and thus immobilized. This blow marks the second occasion where the U.S. government seemingly disregarded the PCSW.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Presidential Committee on the Status of Women has released a press statement in response to the blatant disrespect of the Cabinet. &#8220;The Presidential Commission on the Status of Women condemns the actions of the US Cabinet and the statement made by the Director of the CIA. Director John McCone outwardly expressed the Cabinet\u2019s disinterest in the rights of American women. During a press conference with the PCSW and US Senate, McCone stated that on the list of their priorities, our directives were very low. These directives detailed plans for empowering women in regards to the current state of our nation given the Cuban Missile Crisis. The PCSW would like to express their disappointment in our US Cabinet for not giving their support for half of the US population.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The PCSW remains determined to uphold Eleanor Roosevelt&#8217;s legacy, urging the government to recognize and prioritize the contributions of women to the nation&#8217;s well-being.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the aftermath of the intense discussions with the U.S. Senate and Cabinet, the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women (PCSW) convened to reflect<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":16,"featured_media":679,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[17],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/573"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/16"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=573"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/573\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":680,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/573\/revisions\/680"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/679"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=573"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=573"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=573"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
