The bipartisan organization of 26 members was originally founded by President John F. Kennedy and led by the indomitable Eleanor Roosevelt. The committee, focused on issues ranging from education to insurance and employment, aims to bring changes to existing legislation and provide unwavering support to women in achieving their aspirations. The committee&#8217;s mission revolves around advocating for women&#8217;s rights while considering the evolving societal expectations of the era.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When questioned about his approach to the problem, Dr. Richard Lester, esteemed Chairman of the Economics Department at Princeton University, expressed his commitment to developing solutions that best serve the interests of all women, taking into account the diversity of their experiences and challenges. &#8220;We are here to support women in whatever they aspire to achieve,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our goal is to create an environment where women can thrive in every aspect of their lives.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary objectives of this effort include the establishment of robust labor standards<br>for women, promoting civic empowerment, and extending support to mothers and homemakers. With a notable emphasis on labor standards, as Lester is driven by his expertise as a labor economics professor, he aims to address issues related to workplace inequality and gender-based wage gaps. &#8220;We want to see real change in the lives of American women. This includes pushing for the Equal Pay\/Wages Acts and reaching a consensus on decisions that will truly benefit all women across the nation,&#8221; commented the passionate committee member.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the PCSW prepares to present its proposals to the President, their hopes are high for a future where women are empowered, protected, and provided with equal opportunities in every aspect of American life. With a legacy rooted in the ideals of justice and equality, this organization is poised to make a significant impact on the lives of women throughout the nation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In a renewed effort to address the enduring discrimination faced by women in the United States, the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women (PCSW)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":16,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[17],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/116"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/16"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=116"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/116\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":118,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/116\/revisions\/118"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=116"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=116"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=116"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
