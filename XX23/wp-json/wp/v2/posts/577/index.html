This includes updates on recent bills that were passed, historical sites, the education system, and the migrant situation throughout Chicago. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, there was a bill passed that Dowell was included in that will allow Chicago to bring some of the historical sites back to life. It was mentioned how there was some concern in structural changes, but, it was reassured that no exterior structural changes would be made to any historical structures, and that the interior would be dealt with by the private investors. The main structural changes that would be made would be if there is serious damage to the site. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More recently, there is a bill in the works that relates to mental health awareness in students and teachers. As well as awareness to any issues in relation to bus drivers, which not detail was given on. Other important issues that Dowell is currently looking into and discussing is the issue of environmental education. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After working with Alderperson Nicole Lee from the eleventh ward, the pair were able to pass a bill relating to the migrant situation. This bill aims to reuse old buildings that can be quickly fixed up into housing. This would be a short term solution that would be implemented until a longer term solution is found for this crisis. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Updates on what has been going on within the past few days have been shared from Alderperson Pat Dowell from Ward three.
