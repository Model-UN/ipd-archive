Elon Musk took over the app and has re-named it X, but as the X representative explained, there is a new update to the app, and it is now called, X Connect. The X representative has announced the first round of beta testing that X and that the app is now accessible is many countries across the world. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The X representative stated how, \u201cX AI is used to flag false information.\u201d There are opposing view on this opinion stated by the X representative by the U.S.A. representative. While X is saying that false information will be flagged, the U.S.A. is warning others to watch what they post on X. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>X representative said, \u201cX maps is something that we have never seen before.\u201d Yet, most mobile phones, whether Apple, Samsung, or Google, have some sort of maps app. So why is implementing a map setting into an app on a phone that already has a map built in? It is nothing that we have not already seen before. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur goal is to create an easy use for the user,\u201d X representative shared. Yet the X Connect app is only slightly the same as the original Twitter app that was used before the purchase from Elon Musk. The new features are just getting father off from the original app that everyone did love. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new X Connect app that is being proposed is using AI technology within the app, which has already been discussed negatively by a large population of the public. There have also been some new proposed features that are taking away from the social media aspect of the app, which would seem to take away from the connect aspect of the app that the X representative tried make everyone aware of. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>X, previously known as Twitter, is now providing the world with more updates.
