Foundationally, the UNSC has been agreeing over the fact that violence with violence is not the answer but rather it is necessary to negotiate with peaceful talks and negotiations to further discuss this matter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allied nations such as the U.S., Switzerland, and the UAE have been pushing for humanitarian aid, which the Russian Federation is open to. The U.S. primarily believes that it is important to focus on humanitarian aid first, before implementing other resolutions regarding the Russia-Ukraine war, as these would make humanitarian aid unable to reach the Ukrainian people and this war has been at the expense of the lives of civilians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, due to Ukraine being a bread basket nation and having influence on many others, the impacts of this war such as food insecurity, and trading relations have been brought up due to the sheer economic impact, making it even more imperative to push for humanitarian aid.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, Brazil and China have not resonated with these sentiments as they feel that ending the war quickly should be the main goal. Brazil has proposed itself as a neutral mandator; using neutral grounds is needed to build communication between Russia and Ukraine. Switzerland has pushed back as they also have strong trade relations with both countries, leading to a clash between these two nations.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Russian Federation, despite being open to Humanitarian Aid, has made it very clear that they do not condone NATO countries moving forward towards them. This was opposed by the U.S. and its allies who felt that this war was due to Russia invading a democratic country and have emphasized that they will be supporting the democracy of Ukraine as it is under the same protections as any other country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an interview with the Russian Federation, they shared strong sentiments about how they \u201cwill not yield to these NATO nations that are trying to interfere with our business and our direct conflict that is based in our cultural differences with Ukraine. That is not their business, that is not their place.\u201d Although they have been open to talks, \u201cthere will most likely be very little progress made on this front.\u201d The future of this war depends on these crucial decisions and only time will tell on how they will be able to combat these differences and resolve in favor of the people. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The UNSC has been dealing with heavy disputes regarding the Russia-Ukraine war.
