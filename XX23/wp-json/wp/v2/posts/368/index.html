The previous status of peace between India and China on the border dispute seems to be a stand-still, as both parties claim contrasting perspectives. It has been on record that the two nations appeared to be coming to terms and possibly end the dispute once and for all, up until the yesterday&#8217;s press conference where a press representative for each the China cabinet and Indian Council shared the conflicting accounts of the relations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday, the Indian council made it known during the press conference that they intend not to move on the border and has claimed in the past that expanding borders is not in their interests either. At a press release in the Council yesterday , the Director of Intelligence commented on the matter describing how the Chinese government have been negligent of their offers of diplomatic relations, furthermore the Chinese are the aggressors in this conflict. According to the council, China has been violent and have killed many Indian citizens on the border. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very same press conference yesterday evening, the press representative for the People&#8217;s Republic of China stated, &#8220;India, wrongly claiming Chinese territory as its own has blatantly denied every Chinese attempt at reconciliation. China does not want violence. It wants the people of China to be safe, protected, and well fed, but Nehru has refused a trade deal, reused collaboration on scientific endeavors, refused to engage on our shared ties of decolonization.&#8221; All the while, China was also occupied with internal struggles and growth as they try to recover from the tragic event of the Banqiao Dam collapsing and crude accusations of being involved in the disappearance of the beloved Dalai Lama.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now with the ongoing hostilities and violence between the two it begs the question; &#8220;Who is the real aggressor?&#8221; Both parties claim war is not wanted and have the similar resolution method of communication if the other party is willing. The issue of disinformation being spread threatened the situation and rose tensions, undoubtedly leading us to where we are today in the dispute. Going forward, it seems tensions are only rising and the two Asian nations are on the brink of war. More on this ongoing conflict coming soon in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After the early morning crisis update of the war starting on the border, the side is at fault is still in question.
