Furthermore, it<br>has become increasingly evident that the integration of A.I. into society not only poses a liability<br>to the global economy (via workforce downturns), but also threatens the health of Earth\u2019s<br>environment. With the start of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) plenary meeting<br>on the horizon, the United Kingdom agreed to an interview with the nation\u2019s UNGA delegate<br>Abigail Shaw to discuss the trivial issues at hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interview began with the question: \u201cWhat is the United Kingdom\u2019s stance on the promotion<br>of beneficial artificial intelligence?\u201d Shaw responded by emphasizing that A.I. is a tool that has<br>the potential to dramatically change billions of lives for the better, however, \u201cThe governance of<br>AI technologies must be done correctly in order to encourage meaningful innovation and<br>investment into the technology that also protects the public.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The subsequent question for Shaw was: \u201cHow does the United Kingdom plan to approach the<br>promotion of beneficial artificial intelligence?\u201d Shaw\u2019s response was the proposal of the<br>\u201cL.O.C Plan\u201d, a multifaceted solution whose abbreviation stands for Limits, Oversight, and<br>Creation. Through this plan, the United Kingdoms strives to limit the amount of harmful A.I.<br>available on the internet, implement a UN subcommittee to monitor A.I. activity, and eventually<br>have new beneficial A.I. be created that\u2019s properly regulated from the ground up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As hopeful as the contents of the L.O.C. Plan appear upon first glance, there is still legitimate<br>concern to be had for the lack of consideration towards the effect that artificial intelligence has<br>on the environment. As the A.I. Industry grows, it will have to comply with the U.N. Sustainable<br>Development Goals. At this current rate, studies show that compliance won\u2019t be possible if<br>the energy required to operate artificial intelligence is not harnessed sustainably.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the interview concluded, Shaw provided that the United Kingdom\u2019s hopes for the<br>plenary committee itself are to witness \u201cvivid displays of international diplomacy\u201d in the<br>aspiration that member states of the UNGA can engage in \u201cpeaceful negotiations and dialogue<br>with one another that allows the committee to pass solutions that effectively promote the use of<br>beneficial A.I.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Artificial intelligence (A.I) and its recent surge in global usage has undoubtedly raised a myriadof questions as to how this powerful technology should be used<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[7],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/88"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=88"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/88\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":92,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/88\/revisions\/92"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=88"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=88"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=88"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
