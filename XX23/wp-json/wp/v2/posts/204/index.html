Miss Dorothy Height, President of the National Council of Black Women of America, provided a poignant perspective on the Commission&#8217;s dedicated efforts, particularly in addressing the unique challenges faced by black women in the workforce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miss Height emphasized the need to raise global awareness about the plight of black women, focusing on their struggles in the American labor force. Miss Height emphasized the Commission&#8217;s stance on empowering women, stating, &#8220;I would like to call upon all governments everywhere to notice a black woman of your country and uplift them, do not discriminate. Incorporate them into all sectors of society, make sure they are advocated, and that they are valued as they should be.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Advocating for herself, Miss Height highlighted her valuable perspective as a black woman, aiming to ensure that the voices of black women were heard in high-level government discussions. The Commission&#8217;s strategy reflected a commitment to inclusivity and a recognition of the distinct challenges faced by black women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Senate and PCSW have been collaborating in an effort to improve the condition of women. Recognizing that motherly duties often hindered women&#8217;s progress, the Commission proposed universal daycare and preschool to strengthen the workforce and enable women&#8217;s education. Dr. Richard Lester, Chairman of the Economics Department at Princeton University, discussed the resolution&#8217;s impact on gender disparities, particularly the wage gap. In addition, New York representative Jessica Weis discussed how the Commission aims to encourage the establishment of an Equal Pay Act and anti-discrimination laws covering both gender and race.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Commission primarily has corresponded with the President through letters, their endorsement of policy changes marks a pivotal step toward gender equality. The comprehensive approach taken by the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women in 1962 is laying the foundation for subsequent advancements in women&#8217;s rights, recognizing women as a powerful force for national prosperity.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Presidential Commission on the Status of Women (PCSW) has embarked on a historic mission to enhance the conditions of women in the United States.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":16,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[17],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/204"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/16"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=204"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/204\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":412,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/204\/revisions\/412"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=204"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=204"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=204"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
