It is something that has existed for many years now, some dating back to 2014; almost a decade ago. Since then, as of February of 2022, Russia has sent many troops to go and invade Ukraine. Since that time, many civilians have died, mass destruction has occurred, and the continuous attacks do not seem to be dying down. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many European countries are attempting to help Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, but the United States has also had their fair share of involvement. Including their attempts to provide aid, and spread information about the topic at hand.
