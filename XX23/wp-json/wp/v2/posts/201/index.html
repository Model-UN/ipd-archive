Ministers of the People&#8217;s Republic of China have opened up on their desire for sanctity and peace with India in terms of the conflict. They have also been speaking about their motivations to build longer ties with foreign nations in general.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The violent border dispute has led to the unfortunate loss of around 1,300 Chinese lives, always keeping China on the defense. However, developments show an inclination by China for outreach to India on the matter with optimistic perspectives. Agreement with peace is driven to be made with India through varied forms of cooperation such as trade or research developments. The Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs claims, &#8220;China obviously strives in order to emphasize the importance of communication, and in doing so China hopes to reach out with India in order to promote peace at the Border.&#8221; This attempt at an agreement is forthcoming, yet still in the works as updates have shown. Despite the fluctuating history between China and India, this may be hopeful for the two nations&#8217; futures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only is mutuality with India in the focus of this cabinet but also other foreign affairs and allies with other Asian nations. PRC desires to mitigate their isolationist ways by industrializing and potentially uniting with other nations to have a mutual respect and spread their socialist idealism. The PRC&#8217;s Head of Publicity Department spoke to this topic: &#8220;In a new and open and growing China we need to be open to partners no matter where they come from because ultimately we all share the ultimate goal of socialism, of liberation for the people, for the workers, and simply put the happiness of every citizen.&#8221; China&#8217;s initiative for a new age of growth and global connections is an opportunity for many other nations as well as for China and self-development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Recent development in the border dispute between India and People&#8217;s Republic of China seems to be making its way to resolution and some harmony between<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":280,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[38,34],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/201"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/9"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=201"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/201\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":359,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/201\/revisions\/359"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/280"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=201"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=201"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/live.cimun.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=201"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
