Johnston and his colleauges wished to provide us with a message for the nation. The address reads as follows: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Today I, Senator Olin D. Johnston, stand before members of the Press to address a very important matter. John Locke contended that if the government the people created in the state of nature violated the rights of the citizens and the set laws of the land, the right of revolution would entitle the people to use force to punish that government and depose its rulers. Today, In light of the drastic motions and efforts of the United States Federal Government related to the infringement of state\u2019s rights, it is time that YOU, the people take initiative today, putting the power back in your hands.&nbsp;In accordance with the Second Southern Manifesto, and the Federal Government\u2019s complete disregard of the statements within that document, the people must adhere to those same words of John Locke and impose the &#8216;right of revolution&#8217;. Align yourselves, and make your voices heard by marching to THE CAPITOL. If the United States Government isn\u2019t willing to listen to the representatives of the people, let them hear from the people themselves. \u201c<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The colleagues supporting this address are senators Allen J. Ellender, Richard Russell Jr., Harry F. Byrd, Robert Byrd, and Herman Talmadge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The implications of this incitement of revolt are yet to be seen, and the Washington Post advises all Americans to stay alert as the situation develops.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In an exclusive interview with the Washington Post, Democratic Senator Olin D.
