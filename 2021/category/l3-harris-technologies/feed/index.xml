										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The story broke earlier from AP News that the DoD ordered an investigation into defense contractors, Raytheon, and investigators found evidence of account discrepancies and fraudulent contracts. Investigators also found that while President Joe Biden and his team knew about these discrepancies, and still appointed Former General Lloyd Austin to be Secretary of Defense, despite his ties to Raytheon. An investigation will be launched by The House Armed Forces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Raytheon has faced many controversies and internal issues recently. Just earlier this year, Raytheon delayed their missile defense contract with the US Government for the second time. This was after the contract had been increased to 600 million last June. An anonymous source from the DoD said “I don’t know what the **** Raytheon is doing”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s clear that Raytheon is struggling and their fraudulent behaviour may affect dealings with the government. Many companies are seeing this, and are jumping on the chance to promote their own company in light of the issues at Raytheon.</p>



<p>In an Miami Herald Exclusive with Northrop G Harris III, the company “very strongly denounces Raytheon for what can only be called corruption and funny business.” says Director of Marketing. She also adds that nothing of that sort would ever happen under N.G.H. III and “transparency with our clients is something we strive for.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Director of Strategy and Development clarifies that N.G.H. III is most upset with Raytheon’s “budgetary practices” rather than the CIA agreement. While they are speaking out against Raytheon, they are clearly attempting to maintain ties with the CIA by not condemning their actions. “We do not engage in such underhanded behavior” The Director of Strategy and Development adds.</p>



<p>Related to the controversy at Boeing the Director of Global Business says it is “very concerning” to see such behaviors, but “we are very happy to report that similar situations don’t occur under NGH III.”</p>



<p>If the DoD turns away from Raytheon for business, N.G.H. III is trying to demonstrate they are a similar if not better fit. While not directly bashing on Boeing or Raytheon, N.G.H. III is trying to capture the attention of DoD by condemning the behavior of other Defense Contractors.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>“Multiple Northrop Grumman MQ-4C TRITON rockets went awry in Afghanistan striking and injuring innocent civilians,<strong>” </strong>said an anonymous source Saturday. The source says this is related “directly to poor manufacturing on Northrop&#8217;s end.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a rocket launch headed by Northrop G. Harris III, things went awry resulting in multiple injuries. An investigation into the company suggests that there was an issue with engineering communication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We would like to offer our sincerest apologies for the accident” says Vice President of marketing of Northrop G. Harris III and “we have the best wishes for anyone injured.” She guarantees that Northrop G. Harris III will conduct a “comprehensive internal investigation” into the incident. “If it comes to it, we are prepared to take full responsibility,” she adds.</p>



<p>General Counsel to Northrop G. Harris III assures all products and research currently out are fully functional and useful. Their hope is that the investigation will be beneficial for future innovation and assuring that, upon the results of their investigations, they will take actionable change.</p>



<p>Northrop G. Harris III is trying to maintain their current deals and those still in the works. When asked about their ongoing dealings with Belarus, the director of marketing affirms that they “intend to fulfill all of our contractual obligations to Belarus and will continue working with them however they require our services.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Northrop G Harris III, held a joint meeting with previous companies L3 Harris and Northrop Grumman about press, US contracts, and reaching out to Belarus after the assasination of their President.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a recent press release, Northrop G Harris III assured the public that their merger would not cause issues with monopolisation and “will allow us to offer stronger and more innovative technologies than ever before”. With the combination of the mutually beneficial merger, they hope to “extend our diversified defense technologies to a truly global market”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As events in Belarus escalate, defense companies are competing to supply arms to the Belarus democratic resistance. While not asserted in their agenda, the company hopes to engage Belarus and offer them weapons. Belarus has not made any deals public, but Northrop G Harris III still wishes to support Belarus’ democracy directly, according to the VP of marketing.</p>



<p>The company also wishes to outpace Raytheon and the contract that the DOD is making with them and the CIA,&nbsp; regarding surveillance technology, unmanned vehicles, and drones. This contract was leaked and not made public. While there is no indication of the DOD sending armed forces into Belarus directly, they are engaging in these secret contracts. General Council of Northrop G Harris III&#8217;s calls these private deals with Raytheon “inappropriate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, according to the CFO, there is no want to prioritize one country’s agenda over the other, and upset the DOD, where much of their business goes through. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tonight, defense contractors L3 Harris Technologies and Northrop Grumman both held separate meetings to discuss the possibility of a merger between the two companies. L3 Harris seemed unanimous in their adamant support of the merger in order to “move up in the food chain” says the Investor of Relations of L3 Harris. Northrop Grumman was concerned that a merger would reduce business and competition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>L3 Harris believes that a merger won’t affect competition too much and is “necessary at this point to gain an advantage in the industry,” according to the VP of international business. Northrop Grumman is a larger company that has more international connections. As a company, with the majority of business being American, a merger with Northrop Grumman could increase their market. L3 Harris is unanimous in their support of the merger, and willing to relocate headquarters to Georgia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Northrop Grumman say that, while sufficient in the overlapping areas, they would like to adopt certain L3 Harris business, such as electronic communications. With their goal to increase the international markets, additional expertise in the space industry could add another speciality of the company. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>L3 Harris was awarded a $193.5 million contract for a missile tracking satellite project by the Department of Defense (DOD). Making this their second missile tracking satellite contract from the department in the last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>L3 Harris and Northrop Grumman were awarded $ 121 million and $155 million contracts, respectively, to build prototype sensor satellites that track missiles by the Missile Defense Agency of the DOD on Jan. 14. The agency selected the two companies from a group of four competitors, including Raytheon and Leidos, who were tasked to design a sensor program.</p>



<p>While Raytheon ranks the 5th largest defense company by DefenseNews and L3 Harris ranks the 9th largest defense company, this is the second time in the last year that Raytheon was beaten by L3 Harris. The L3 communications and Harris Corp merger in 2019 made 2020 their first year as a collective company, with an annual revenue of $18 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October of 2020, L3 Harris was awarded another contract of $193.5 million by the Space Development Agency on Oct. 5, 2020 to build 4 missile tracking satellites each. Raytheon, another competitor for the project, filed two separate protests against the government’s evaluation process. These were dismissed by the Government Accountability Office after the SDA agreed to reevaluate. They found that L3 Harris and SpaceX were the proper fit and readministered their contracts.</p>



<p>“Competition is essential in all industries but it&#8217;s especially important in defense, to allow&nbsp; innovation and reasonable prices,” says the Secretary of Defense of the DOD.&nbsp; According to her, competition is necessary to prevent monopolisation of the industry. The merger of L3 communications and Harris corps concerned the DOD at first because these two companies were the only ones who produced necessary equipment for military-grade night vision goggles, and their merger would result in monopolisation of this product. The issue was resolved with the divestiture of one of the company’s investment in this product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Competitive spirit fuels innovation and creates an&nbsp; incentive for us to be better than those who are better than us,” says a consultant of Northrop Grumman. She knows that competition is imperative for success in the industry and to produce the best possible products at reasonable prices.</p>
