<p>The House of Commons is discussing which member of parliament has been committing treasonous acts against the UK in the Falkland Islands. The Prime Minister revealed to the House of Commons that there was one member of parliament that created instability in the government and risked the lives of Argentinians and British citizens in the Falkland Islands and abroad. </p>



<p>The House believes that the traitor is Patrick Wall. &#8220;Patrick Wall has been switching his own policy from the beginning,&#8221; said one anonymous member of parliament. &#8220;He made one too many compromises with the Labour party and would do anything for his bill to go through. Also, his bowler hat sucks.&#8221; Another member said he was &#8220;mentally, physically, and emotionally abused by our traitor, Patrick Wall.&#8221; </p>



<p>Prime Minister Thatcher revived the intercepted note, detailing with irrefutable proof that the traitor is Patrick Wall. Wall is now considered a traitor to the UK and will be punished accordingly. The committee is convinced that Patrick Wall is at fault, and investigating how this treason occurred, leaving everyone wondering, what on earth is going on in the House of Commons?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In an emergency crisis early this morning the cabinet of the UK convened to solve the Falkland islands crisis and the Soviet control of the Afghan government. The Cabinet reached a new and restrengthened alliance between the US and the UK in regard to the Falkland Islands. The Falkland islands are off the southern coast of South America, and due to the close proximity of the US, their CIA will supply intelligence and put diplomatic pressure on the islands, as well as impose sanctions upon Argentina.<br>The cabinet then tackled the crisis of the USSR&#8217;s presence in Afghanistan. The UK cabinet is taking anti-communist actions and is in valiant support of the Mujahadeen and stands strong against communism. With the outcome of Ronald Regan&#8217;s health still uncertain, the UK may give into the demands of the USSR. The UK is firmly against communism but lacks the action and strength to defend democracy until the last second. The UK debated the possible idea of surrendering to Afghanistan and the USSR.</p>



<p><br>When Le Monde informed the UK cabinet of the Soviet invasion of the Afghan government, the UK responded by saying that the USSR just has close ties to the Afghan government working together, but there is no infiltration of the government. Despite direct quotes from the USSR ministers, the UK was adamant about this fact.</p>



<p><br>Additionally, with the betrayal in the house of commons, the cabinet is investigating the treasonous actions of a member of parliament initiating an offensive attack into the Falkland Islands risking the lives of the British and Argentinian people living there. The House of Commons, The UK Cabinet, and Margret Thatcher are all working diligently to investigate and prosecute the offender.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thatcher has inspired the conservatives to promote anti-U.S. rhetoric. Members of Parliament have claimed that &#8220;Britain is the greatest country in the world&#8221;, taking advantage of the current U.S. crisis to further their own agenda. At this moment in time, parts of the House of Commons are against the U.S. despite their generous promises of coal aid. The coal dispute is now in question by the U.K. and they are almost ready to go against the deal, which would result in the starvation and suffering of the British people. This spiteful decision neglects the needs of the British people, and for what reason? To frustrate the U.S.?</p>



<p>U.S. comments about Britain have &#8220;pissed Thatcher off&#8221; and the conservative House of Commons will of course stand by their Prime Minister. They go so far as to express their love for the PM by ending their statements with &#8220;I love Thatcher!&#8221; However, Prime Minister Thatcher sent a secret memo to the members of the conservative party in the House of Commons addressing unnamed party members that have &#8220;failed on their promises of loyalty to the United Kingdom.&#8221; The memo contains a thinly veiled threat to &#8220;take care of&#8221; potential &#8220;traitors&#8221;. The Labor Party and Conservative Party have always been at odds, but now the division in the House of Commons has seeped so deep that the close knit party is starting to divide. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Britain&#8217;s brutalization of Argentinian forces over the occupation of the Falklands seems to have inflated the egos of House of Commons representatives. They callously deem this conflict as an &#8220;economic opportunity&#8221; and discuss plans to initiate a war with Argentina. The consensus of the body establishes that &#8220;war is imminent&#8221; and slanders Argentina by deeming the country as &#8220;aggressors.&#8221;</p>



<p>It is confirmed by a House of Commons member that the U.K. is working to &#8220;preemptively&#8221; attack Argentina. The only justification for this is Argentina&#8217;s supposed antagonizing of the U.K., which was merely a question of Argentina defending their rightful territory. This proposition of extreme violence serves as a statement to establish that the U.K. is &#8220;the greatest country in the world&#8221; and that &#8220;if war is what it takes to prove it, so be it.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Conservative Party in the House is working on a paper named &#8220;Beating Argentina Badly Efficiently&#8221; to begin militarizing the Falklands in an attempt to intimidate and bombard Argentina. The aggressively named paper is being kept under wraps to avoid attention from other nations—especially the U.S. The U.K. is looking to convert current residents of the Falklands to British citizens and extend U.K. infrastructure. Establishing a 45,000 strong military presence in the Falklands will serve to help Britain maintain its dictator-like control over the islands. The paper goes so far as to condone lethal violence and &#8220;extermination&#8221; against those &#8220;invaders&#8221; who oppose their reign.</p>

<p>Rumors circulate about potential conflict between the ostensibly steadfast allies, the U.S. and the U.K.  Alleged &#8220;protests&#8221; were observed to be occurring in the closed session between the countries. </p>



<p>A House of Commons member accused a U.S. delegate of plotting to veto a U.K. proposal in relation to fighting against communism. </p>



<p>The House of Commons&#8217; reactions to certain topics discussed between the two countries during the signing of a new public treaty alludes to present conflicts, perhaps within the House itself. </p>



<p>The U.K. received extremely mixed reactions from the House when speaking about abolishing unions. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher initially declined to comment on future union plans, but later established plans to rid the U.K. of all union organizations.</p>



<p>Accusations were thrown at the U.K. Secretary of Energy, with a member of the House calling them a potential &#8220;conservative traitor&#8221;. This was met with anger from Prime Minister Thatcher, who swiftly denied such a thing. </p>



<p>Despite all the evidence that points towards antagonism on these multiple levels, the U.S. Central Intelligence Director vehemently denies all accusations of conflict between the U.S. and the U.K.. President Ronald Reagan also firmly dismisses any such ideas. The bond between the two countries is only further strengthened by their mutual desire to end communism across the globe. Though the meeting between the two cabinets was initially hectic, their common goal and strong partnership prevailed. </p>

<p>The cabinet of the United Kingdom finds itself in a difficult place as there is a real threat to Britain’s main source of energy. In recent events, the Government of Her Majesty the Queen has condemned the misuse of the labor union system.</p>



<p>In a recent meeting with her Majesty the Queen’s cabinet, a National Union of Mineworkers representative, Patricia Longsong, tension was especially high. Longsong, in a letter to the cabinet, listed the demands of the unions, such demands include the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>A 15% raise for all workers in UK Coal Pits</li>



<li>The end of any plans to UK Coal Pits</li>



<li>Continuation of subsidies to UK Coal Mines</li>



<li>Cessation of government’s “Anti union propaganda system”</li>



<li>Public statement of support for unions by PM Thatcher</li>
</ul>



<p>Prime Minister Thatcher challenged this by calmly stating that the Union is “lining their own pockets”. The UK maintains that the union is corrupted by greed, not protecting the interests of the individuals they represent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The coal industry has a large impact on the people of the United Kingdom, Her Majesty’s cabinet maintains that both the Cabinet and Margret Thatcher are with the people of England. A Cabinet member stated in an interview, “we are not going to meet the demands of the coal strike as it is detrimental to Great Britain”. With tens of thousands without power in the coming future, the cabinet is working diligently to maintain the welfare of the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>
