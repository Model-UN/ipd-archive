<p>Hot off of accusations that its ally Syria is engaging in chemical warfare, the USSR is pressuring Iran to cede the territories of Golestan, North Khorasan, and Razavo Khorasan due to claims of civilian killings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The USSR has accused Iran of killing USSR civilians in its northeastern provinces, stating that Iran has “endangered and already killed thousands of innocent civilians” in the provinces of Golestan, North Khorasan, and Razavi Khorasan, and thus requests to occupy said provinces.</p>



<p>It is important to note that the war between Iraq and Iran is occurring along the western border of Iran, with Iraq fighting a 2-front war between Syria to the west and Iran to the east.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8Q0ML2L8YV6PJB1ns9_ei-8aPrTmBsafGE9ML_2u1fv03Mq-BtncbE6qFcvsGDmCHG8JfOsR1kmmi_F-u5DnUN3JpT8otN5tMXuctYK7ArI4RmvZj5pQ0F_nGrYKmNkXb-zA7ZFSjZ3gY0MRhJDG6Q0" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Iran has asserted that the war is occurring nowhere close to possible USSR civilians, claiming that the USSR is threatening Iran with military action.</p>



<p>The Iranian Minister of Petroleum states that “it seems like the USSR has the worst intentions for the Middle East” and is beginning to establish a demilitarized zone within the provinces, along with seeking diplomatic negotiations with the USSR.</p>



<p>The Minister of Petroleum is also requesting the international community to take notice, stressing that “we hope the international community and especially the U.S. can recognize the severity of the USSR’s deception and their threat at this moment.”</p>



<p>Additionally, the Iraqi cabinet has accused Iran’s ally Syria of using chemical warfare and thus violating the Geneva Convention during its incursion into the western borders of Iraq.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs from Iraq calls upon the Arab League to take action against Iran, stating: “There’s a great importance that the Arab League applies trade sanctions against Iran so that the Iranian and Syrian treachery can near an end.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iran states that it’s currently looking into the accusations of chemical warfare and reconsidering its relationship with Syria, however, they are still allying with them.</p>

<p>The House of Commons is discussing which member of parliament has been committing treasonous acts against the UK in the Falkland Islands. The Prime Minister revealed to the House of Commons that there was one member of parliament that created instability in the government and risked the lives of Argentinians and British citizens in the Falkland Islands and abroad. </p>



<p>The House believes that the traitor is Patrick Wall. &#8220;Patrick Wall has been switching his own policy from the beginning,&#8221; said one anonymous member of parliament. &#8220;He made one too many compromises with the Labour party and would do anything for his bill to go through. Also, his bowler hat sucks.&#8221; Another member said he was &#8220;mentally, physically, and emotionally abused by our traitor, Patrick Wall.&#8221; </p>



<p>Prime Minister Thatcher revived the intercepted note, detailing with irrefutable proof that the traitor is Patrick Wall. Wall is now considered a traitor to the UK and will be punished accordingly. The committee is convinced that Patrick Wall is at fault, and investigating how this treason occurred, leaving everyone wondering, what on earth is going on in the House of Commons?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In an emergency crisis early this morning the cabinet of the UK convened to solve the Falkland islands crisis and the Soviet control of the Afghan government. The Cabinet reached a new and restrengthened alliance between the US and the UK in regard to the Falkland Islands. The Falkland islands are off the southern coast of South America, and due to the close proximity of the US, their CIA will supply intelligence and put diplomatic pressure on the islands, as well as impose sanctions upon Argentina.<br>The cabinet then tackled the crisis of the USSR&#8217;s presence in Afghanistan. The UK cabinet is taking anti-communist actions and is in valiant support of the Mujahadeen and stands strong against communism. With the outcome of Ronald Regan&#8217;s health still uncertain, the UK may give into the demands of the USSR. The UK is firmly against communism but lacks the action and strength to defend democracy until the last second. The UK debated the possible idea of surrendering to Afghanistan and the USSR.</p>



<p><br>When Le Monde informed the UK cabinet of the Soviet invasion of the Afghan government, the UK responded by saying that the USSR just has close ties to the Afghan government working together, but there is no infiltration of the government. Despite direct quotes from the USSR ministers, the UK was adamant about this fact.</p>



<p><br>Additionally, with the betrayal in the house of commons, the cabinet is investigating the treasonous actions of a member of parliament initiating an offensive attack into the Falkland Islands risking the lives of the British and Argentinian people living there. The House of Commons, The UK Cabinet, and Margret Thatcher are all working diligently to investigate and prosecute the offender.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://press.cimun.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-18-1024x538.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1548" srcset="/ipd-archive/XIX23/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-18-1024x538.png 1024w, /ipd-archive/XIX23/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-18-300x158.png 300w, /ipd-archive/XIX23/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-18-768x403.png 768w, /ipd-archive/XIX23/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-18.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">USSR militarily invades Afghanistan</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the winter of 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan to induct a new regime to solidify Afghanistan as an ally on the southern border, this action did not come without controversy. The United States of America was a main proponent of objecting to this invasion, by supporting a collection of Muslim rebels, the Mujahideen, to rise against the nation. Conflict consumed Afghanistan resulting in numerous civilian deaths and an enormous refugee crisis, and the future remains uncertain.</p>



<p>The USSR Cabinet told reporters explicitly that focusing inward on the USSR is more important than international conflicts. The secretaries said that the cabinet recently passed a directive that emphasizes internal infrastructure. The USSR is highlighting general education, due to the struggles of getting equal access to quality education, as well as emphasizing the multiculturality of the USSR and discussing plans on how to support and preserve these cultures. However, all this talk of bettering the USSR is a lie, the USSR is using this as a disguise to seize the nation of Afghanistan and control their government.</p>



<p>When Le Monde informed the U.S. cabinet of the extreme action taken by the Soviets the cabinet&#8217;s response was underwhelming at best. The U.S. Cabinet was consumed with the attempted assassination of President Reagan, who remains in critical condition, and spent their time picking our flowers for the president, instead of the obvious pressing issue, the dominance of communism in the east. The USSR&#8217;s invasion of Afghanistan and control of their government secures another communist nation, tipping the scales closer to the USSR&#8217;s communist world instead of the U.S.&#8217;s democratic fantasy.</p>



<p>The U.S. cabinet is struggling to handle more than one issue at a time, leading to the question is the cabinet competent enough to handle international affairs, especially in regard to the USSR? The blatant power grab by the USSR should not go unnoticed or unpunished, by invalidating the former Afghan government, the Middle East may descend into instability or worse communism. How will the world respond to a sleeping United States and a dominating USSR?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Britain&#8217;s brutalization of Argentinian forces over the occupation of the Falklands seems to have inflated the egos of House of Commons representatives. They callously deem this conflict as an &#8220;economic opportunity&#8221; and discuss plans to initiate a war with Argentina. The consensus of the body establishes that &#8220;war is imminent&#8221; and slanders Argentina by deeming the country as &#8220;aggressors.&#8221;</p>



<p>It is confirmed by a House of Commons member that the U.K. is working to &#8220;preemptively&#8221; attack Argentina. The only justification for this is Argentina&#8217;s supposed antagonizing of the U.K., which was merely a question of Argentina defending their rightful territory. This proposition of extreme violence serves as a statement to establish that the U.K. is &#8220;the greatest country in the world&#8221; and that &#8220;if war is what it takes to prove it, so be it.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Conservative Party in the House is working on a paper named &#8220;Beating Argentina Badly Efficiently&#8221; to begin militarizing the Falklands in an attempt to intimidate and bombard Argentina. The aggressively named paper is being kept under wraps to avoid attention from other nations—especially the U.S. The U.K. is looking to convert current residents of the Falklands to British citizens and extend U.K. infrastructure. Establishing a 45,000 strong military presence in the Falklands will serve to help Britain maintain its dictator-like control over the islands. The paper goes so far as to condone lethal violence and &#8220;extermination&#8221; against those &#8220;invaders&#8221; who oppose their reign.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When it comes to war crimes, how far is too far? The 1982 UNSC got into a heated debate this afternoon around the USSR&#8217;s actions, both past and present. As stated on Twitter, the USA representative was vindictive in their assertions, stating that the USSR had committed crimes which had gone unpunished by other global powers. While the USA mainly cited the Soviet Gulags, Japan was quick to condemn communism and was immediately criticized by the Zairian representative. The Japanese may not be well-liked on the world stage, as they played a major role in colonialism as part of World War II. This involvement was brought up by the Zairian representative as an example of Japanese hypocrisy. Could Japan rebound from this and stay in good international standings? Earlier this morning, the US representative expressed their annoyance with the UNSC&#8217;s issue with &#8220;going in circles&#8221;. How long the Council can go in circles without coming to conclusions remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The House of Commons is getting loud! Plenty of commotion on the floor. If you pass the Monroe room, you will hear hissing, cheering, talking, clapping, etc. You will also hear the sound of multiple working papers in progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With around five working papers on the floor, they hope to address the domestic economic crisis and secure the homeland against external threats. Currently, a significant paper on the floor is the M.A.R.G.A.R.E.T (the act of making additional reforms, gains, and amends to revitalize the economic transformation act). The paper highlights the hopes to bring the parliament together in nonpartisan ways and recognize the need for British people and all included, especially given the ongoing recession and unstable job market. With multiple more papers on the floor, we are excited to see what is to come.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="634" src="https://press.cimun.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-13-1024x634.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1201" srcset="/ipd-archive/XIX23/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-13-1024x634.png 1024w, /ipd-archive/XIX23/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-13-300x186.png 300w, /ipd-archive/XIX23/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-13-768x476.png 768w, /ipd-archive/XIX23/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-13.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">United Nations Security Council 1980</figcaption></figure>



<p><br>The United Nations Security Council (1982) is currently debating the Russian invasion of Afghanistan. The United States of America is attempting to temporarily suspend the USSR from the Security Council on the grounds of violation of the Geneva Convention. The USSR retaliated to this idea by threatening to wage war on the United States due to policy differences. The United States has answered as peacefully as possible, that they want to remain peaceful and secure the nation of Afghanistan.</p>



<p>However, finding a resolution that most of the representatives in the council can agree upon is proving to be a difficult task. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are going in circles,&#8221; said a representative from the USA. </p>



<p>The council is frustrated between reckoning with opposing views. The U.K. is neutral, Poland doesn&#8217;t support force against USSR, Zaire believes the U.S. should stop supporting the Mujahideen, China is in favor of stopping the war and the USSR plans to continue opposition, despite plans from global superpower the USA alleging that the USSR has committed war crimes.</p>



<p>Additionally, the U.S. and Japan are the only nations wishing to punish the USSR for their criminal actions. The remainder of the Security Xouncil refuses to condemn the Soviet&#8217;s action. Begging the question has the world lost its strength against the USSR? Even if the U.S. is the lone actor seeking action against Russia, the U.S. will act. The U.S. will stop at nothing to see communism fall and the USSR lose influence across the world.</p>

<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size">Things are getting hot at the UN General Assembly! The UNGA talks about military technology that exists in space and beyond the planet. The delegations appear to get along well and have been able to come to some sort of consensus. They underscore, grabbing the Paraguayan delegation aside, &#8220;A resolution that helps underdeveloped and developed countries have equal opportunity in outer space has around 20 signatories and I am hopeful that the resolution will pass.&#8221; Despite the partial agreement, it was clear from seeing the unmoderated caucus that this committee was not all love and peace. Several developing nations, including Zambia and Paraguay, have said they wish to pool their resources, money, and energies to the best of their abilities to make the world&#8217;s outer space more equal. Other nations, like Iran, prioritize developing nations and their resources to build the &#8220;footing&#8221; of space. Only time will tell how the chips lay in UNGA. I think whoever has the money to fund it should just fund everything.</p>

<p>The cabinet of the United Kingdom finds itself in a difficult place as there is a real threat to Britain’s main source of energy. In recent events, the Government of Her Majesty the Queen has condemned the misuse of the labor union system.</p>



<p>In a recent meeting with her Majesty the Queen’s cabinet, a National Union of Mineworkers representative, Patricia Longsong, tension was especially high. Longsong, in a letter to the cabinet, listed the demands of the unions, such demands include the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>A 15% raise for all workers in UK Coal Pits</li>



<li>The end of any plans to UK Coal Pits</li>



<li>Continuation of subsidies to UK Coal Mines</li>



<li>Cessation of government’s “Anti union propaganda system”</li>



<li>Public statement of support for unions by PM Thatcher</li>
</ul>



<p>Prime Minister Thatcher challenged this by calmly stating that the Union is “lining their own pockets”. The UK maintains that the union is corrupted by greed, not protecting the interests of the individuals they represent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The coal industry has a large impact on the people of the United Kingdom, Her Majesty’s cabinet maintains that both the Cabinet and Margret Thatcher are with the people of England. A Cabinet member stated in an interview, “we are not going to meet the demands of the coal strike as it is detrimental to Great Britain”. With tens of thousands without power in the coming future, the cabinet is working diligently to maintain the welfare of the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>
