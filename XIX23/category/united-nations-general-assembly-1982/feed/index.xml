										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Britain&#8217;s brutalization of Argentinian forces over the occupation of the Falklands seems to have inflated the egos of House of Commons representatives. They callously deem this conflict as an &#8220;economic opportunity&#8221; and discuss plans to initiate a war with Argentina. The consensus of the body establishes that &#8220;war is imminent&#8221; and slanders Argentina by deeming the country as &#8220;aggressors.&#8221;</p>



<p>It is confirmed by a House of Commons member that the U.K. is working to &#8220;preemptively&#8221; attack Argentina. The only justification for this is Argentina&#8217;s supposed antagonizing of the U.K., which was merely a question of Argentina defending their rightful territory. This proposition of extreme violence serves as a statement to establish that the U.K. is &#8220;the greatest country in the world&#8221; and that &#8220;if war is what it takes to prove it, so be it.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Conservative Party in the House is working on a paper named &#8220;Beating Argentina Badly Efficiently&#8221; to begin militarizing the Falklands in an attempt to intimidate and bombard Argentina. The aggressively named paper is being kept under wraps to avoid attention from other nations—especially the U.S. The U.K. is looking to convert current residents of the Falklands to British citizens and extend U.K. infrastructure. Establishing a 45,000 strong military presence in the Falklands will serve to help Britain maintain its dictator-like control over the islands. The paper goes so far as to condone lethal violence and &#8220;extermination&#8221; against those &#8220;invaders&#8221; who oppose their reign.</p>

<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size">Things are getting hot at the UN General Assembly! The UNGA talks about military technology that exists in space and beyond the planet. The delegations appear to get along well and have been able to come to some sort of consensus. They underscore, grabbing the Paraguayan delegation aside, &#8220;A resolution that helps underdeveloped and developed countries have equal opportunity in outer space has around 20 signatories and I am hopeful that the resolution will pass.&#8221; Despite the partial agreement, it was clear from seeing the unmoderated caucus that this committee was not all love and peace. Several developing nations, including Zambia and Paraguay, have said they wish to pool their resources, money, and energies to the best of their abilities to make the world&#8217;s outer space more equal. Other nations, like Iran, prioritize developing nations and their resources to build the &#8220;footing&#8221; of space. Only time will tell how the chips lay in UNGA. I think whoever has the money to fund it should just fund everything.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[&#8220;Let Japan&#8217;s pain serve as a lesson to all countries considering nuclear warfare.&#8221; &#8211; UNSC Representative of Japan As evidenced by the aftermath of Hiroshima]]></description>

<p>&#8220;Let Japan&#8217;s pain serve as a lesson to all countries considering nuclear warfare.&#8221;                                 </p>
<cite> &#8211; UNSC Representative of Japan</cite></blockquote>



<p>As evidenced by the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, no other country is as uniquely positioned to understand the significance of nuclear weapons as Japan. The UNSC Representative of Japan discusses the need for a revision in the globe&#8217;s attitude towards nuclear warfare in an exclusive interview. The rapidly growing desire of many nations to increase their nuclear stockpiles is more than enough cause for concern. Instead of addressing how to control the usage of such destructive weaponry, Japan argues that the focus should be on abolishing the use of nuclear weapons entirely. </p>



<p>&#8220;Japan has experienced the wrath of atomic warfare firsthand. Turning to nuclear violence is always the worst possible option; all nations, whether they are directly involved in the conflict or not, suffer from the consequences.&#8221; To state the issue plainly, Japan believes that no countries should have access to nuclear weaponry at all. The general reason behind nations working to increase their collections of arms is because said nations are seeking ways to defend themselves from other countries with nuclear weapons. As one country&#8217;s arsenal increases, another country does the same out of the fear of attack.</p>



<p>If the possibility of nuclear attack is negated entirely, then there would be no need for any state to fear such a large scale attack. The back and forth paranoia would greatly diminish. Some may argue that nations need to have access to nuclear weapons in order to deter others from attacking, but if there are <em>no weapons</em> to attack other countries with, then the threat reduces greatly across the board. Any country who actively stands by nuclear proliferation must have an ulterior motive—what other reason is there to support such violent methods?</p>
