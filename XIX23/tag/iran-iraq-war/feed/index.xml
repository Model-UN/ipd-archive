<p>With the Iran-Iraq war continuing for over a year, Iran, Iraq, and Russia are divided &#8212; not only against each other, but among themselves.</p>



<p>However, one faction has joined forces: the USSR and Iraq.</p>



<p>While notorious for secrecy, The Sun has received an anonymous report about a meeting between the USSR and Iraq, where a member of the USSR cabinet was reportedly heard saying to Iraq: “our house is your house.” </p>



<p>However, the USSR is burdened with the loss of a member of its cabinet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this meeting, the USSR stated that the recently deceased Finance Minister of the USSR was discovered to be colluding with members of the Iranian cabinet.</p>



<p>Could the USSR have “disappeared” the Minister of Finance for political purposes? Is the USSR providing nuclear resources to Iraq? Only time will tell.</p>



<p>In other news, Iraq is experiencing internal turmoil along its southern border, incited by Ayatollah Khomeini’s words: “to our brothers in Iraq especially, I turn to you now. You know in your hearts that the mongrel demon-spawn of the greater Satan Saddam Hussein will never care for you…now it is time for you to be freed of your oppressor in accordance with the wishes of the Muslim people, and the true Sharia!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such words have invoked the “righteous” fervor of Iraqi citizens and have led to several civilian arrests in Iraq.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response, the Ambassador to the United Nations for Iraq offered a “sneak peek” of a future directive to The Sun, hinting at creating literacy programs and actions to reduce hunger in the population.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Iran, after discovering the news of a collaboration between the deceased Finance Minister of the USSR and a member of their cabinet, accusations went flying about a possible “traitor” in their midst.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the Iran-Iraq war in the midst of its first year, both sides of the conflict are experiencing similar troubles.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/p4rOMIyh9qeN9oWDs5Ptr0KrPE1wXKpPFVXWIBHHB6-P8TiQYUCh26-3o__0GzTseJ-LXjMq3Umk858KdBmbVc-WeXjUxaKfz87UA_Jl9nCDltF9_AXNRkLBrGwKIuCdWivys5xZn_zzU2qRNYzxBhM" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Recently,&nbsp; the Iranian Cabinet has gained additional allies in the Iran-Iraq war, countering the support the Arab League provides to Iraq’s military, of which appears to be more divided than it may seem.</p>



<p>Iraq, as part of the Arab League, has long had resources to draw upon from its neighboring countries. Such support from the Arab League was demonstrated today, when Iraq’s Minister of Foreign Affairs delivered a rousing speech claiming that Iraq would achieve stability in the Middle East if it defeated Iran in the ongoing Iran-Iraq war. Conversely, the minister also warned of the consequences in the event of an Iranian victory: “If Iran wins this war, then it poses a threat to the entire Middle East”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, during a question and answer segment, detractors spoke up: the delegation from Libya questioned Iraq’s “aggressive” stance in the invasion of Iran, to which the Foreign Minister stated: “Iraq is the sword that protects the entire Middle East”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is important to note that Iran is not in the Arab League. However, this does not mean that Iran is without allies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a recent interview The Sun conducted with The Minister of Petroleum in the Iran Cabinet, he stated that the Iranian Cabinet had written directives to ally with and buy weapons from Romania and North Yemen, adding: “When we are going to other countries, we are not going for some ideological basis that has been perpetuated by the Cold War”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is cooperated by a document The Sun obtained from the Iran Cabinet, where “R” stands for Romania and “NY” stands for North Yemen.</p>

<p>What does this mean for Iraq? Well, we can turn to a correspondence the delegate for Iraq in the Arab League sent to their cabinet. This war will not only be a “war of attention” that the delegate most certainly misspelled, as both countries may turn to additional Western countries for aid, but also a “war of attrition” where evenly matched militaries reach a deadlock, where they each attempt to capture yards, not kilometers of territory. Even if the delegate for Iraq made a simple spelling error, this time, it’s important to listen to what he means, and<strong> </strong>what he says. </p>
