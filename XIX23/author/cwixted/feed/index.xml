<p>The House of Commons is discussing which member of parliament has been committing treasonous acts against the UK in the Falkland Islands. The Prime Minister revealed to the House of Commons that there was one member of parliament that created instability in the government and risked the lives of Argentinians and British citizens in the Falkland Islands and abroad. </p>



<p>The House believes that the traitor is Patrick Wall. &#8220;Patrick Wall has been switching his own policy from the beginning,&#8221; said one anonymous member of parliament. &#8220;He made one too many compromises with the Labour party and would do anything for his bill to go through. Also, his bowler hat sucks.&#8221; Another member said he was &#8220;mentally, physically, and emotionally abused by our traitor, Patrick Wall.&#8221; </p>



<p>Prime Minister Thatcher revived the intercepted note, detailing with irrefutable proof that the traitor is Patrick Wall. Wall is now considered a traitor to the UK and will be punished accordingly. The committee is convinced that Patrick Wall is at fault, and investigating how this treason occurred, leaving everyone wondering, what on earth is going on in the House of Commons?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In an emergency crisis early this morning the cabinet of the UK convened to solve the Falkland islands crisis and the Soviet control of the Afghan government. The Cabinet reached a new and restrengthened alliance between the US and the UK in regard to the Falkland Islands. The Falkland islands are off the southern coast of South America, and due to the close proximity of the US, their CIA will supply intelligence and put diplomatic pressure on the islands, as well as impose sanctions upon Argentina.<br>The cabinet then tackled the crisis of the USSR&#8217;s presence in Afghanistan. The UK cabinet is taking anti-communist actions and is in valiant support of the Mujahadeen and stands strong against communism. With the outcome of Ronald Regan&#8217;s health still uncertain, the UK may give into the demands of the USSR. The UK is firmly against communism but lacks the action and strength to defend democracy until the last second. The UK debated the possible idea of surrendering to Afghanistan and the USSR.</p>



<p><br>When Le Monde informed the UK cabinet of the Soviet invasion of the Afghan government, the UK responded by saying that the USSR just has close ties to the Afghan government working together, but there is no infiltration of the government. Despite direct quotes from the USSR ministers, the UK was adamant about this fact.</p>



<p><br>Additionally, with the betrayal in the house of commons, the cabinet is investigating the treasonous actions of a member of parliament initiating an offensive attack into the Falkland Islands risking the lives of the British and Argentinian people living there. The House of Commons, The UK Cabinet, and Margret Thatcher are all working diligently to investigate and prosecute the offender.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://press.cimun.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-18-1024x538.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1548" srcset="/ipd-archive/XIX23/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-18-1024x538.png 1024w, /ipd-archive/XIX23/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-18-300x158.png 300w, /ipd-archive/XIX23/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-18-768x403.png 768w, /ipd-archive/XIX23/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-18.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">USSR militarily invades Afghanistan</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the winter of 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan to induct a new regime to solidify Afghanistan as an ally on the southern border, this action did not come without controversy. The United States of America was a main proponent of objecting to this invasion, by supporting a collection of Muslim rebels, the Mujahideen, to rise against the nation. Conflict consumed Afghanistan resulting in numerous civilian deaths and an enormous refugee crisis, and the future remains uncertain.</p>



<p>The USSR Cabinet told reporters explicitly that focusing inward on the USSR is more important than international conflicts. The secretaries said that the cabinet recently passed a directive that emphasizes internal infrastructure. The USSR is highlighting general education, due to the struggles of getting equal access to quality education, as well as emphasizing the multiculturality of the USSR and discussing plans on how to support and preserve these cultures. However, all this talk of bettering the USSR is a lie, the USSR is using this as a disguise to seize the nation of Afghanistan and control their government.</p>



<p>When Le Monde informed the U.S. cabinet of the extreme action taken by the Soviets the cabinet&#8217;s response was underwhelming at best. The U.S. Cabinet was consumed with the attempted assassination of President Reagan, who remains in critical condition, and spent their time picking our flowers for the president, instead of the obvious pressing issue, the dominance of communism in the east. The USSR&#8217;s invasion of Afghanistan and control of their government secures another communist nation, tipping the scales closer to the USSR&#8217;s communist world instead of the U.S.&#8217;s democratic fantasy.</p>



<p>The U.S. cabinet is struggling to handle more than one issue at a time, leading to the question is the cabinet competent enough to handle international affairs, especially in regard to the USSR? The blatant power grab by the USSR should not go unnoticed or unpunished, by invalidating the former Afghan government, the Middle East may descend into instability or worse communism. How will the world respond to a sleeping United States and a dominating USSR?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Questions with the prime minister resume in the British House of Commons discussing issues ranging from the recent crisis of a mob in Manchester protesting over the coal labour strike to England&#8217;s disdain for Ireland. The Prime Minister secured a deal with the USA to obtain enough coal for the UK to stay warm this winter and as long as the nation needs. The bill the Prime Minister is working on has to do with making union-themed violence a more harshly prosecuted crime and urges the House to vote for this bill. When questioned if Thatcher’s close personal relationship with American president Ronald Reagan influenced the bill, Thatcher responded by defending the strong relationship between the U.K. and the U.S.</p>



<p>Several ministers made suggestions and gave commentary about the hill, most notably Winston Churchill asking the Prime Minister if she thought that increasing interest rates for banks would be an adequate solution to solving the ongoing tense relationship between unions and the government, and the Prime Minister agreed that it was a brilliant idea, and plans to implement it soon.</p>



<p>The conservative party&#8217;s stronghold on parliament leads to the dismissal of labour party ideas and policy in the House. Labour party suggestions such as taking away excess spending money from citizens were completely overlooked and outright mocked. When the labour party brought up the leaked note detailing how there are traitors within the conservative party working diligently to oust Thatcher, the Prime Minister simply responded by saying that the conservative party is the dominant party, and the labour party is simply in the bitter majority.</p>



<p>Following the questioning, the ministers debated Thatcher&#8217;s commitment to her promises of supporting workers&#8217; rights and dissolving the monopoly unions have on the workforce. Thatcher was devoted to putting an end to union violence, but ministers are unconvinced. The divide between parties looms large over the House and is splitting the objectives like hair. Ministers noted Thatcher&#8217;s sentiments to be about dismantling unions when a large faction believes that simply limiting union power is enough. The House of Commons needs to be closely monitored as tensions continue to rise between the parties.</p>

<p>The Janes is an organization founded in the 60s the as an &#8220;underground abortion network to bring abortions back to give people access to these vital lifesaving services for people in Illinois and Chicago for those who need it,&#8221; the Lead Activist of the Janes said. Today the Janes peacefully protested outside of the White House to get the attention of President Biden. &#8220;The White House has refused to meet with the janes so we will force them to listen” the Co-Founder of the Janes reported. The Biden administration hasn&#8217;t done enough and the Janes can&#8217;t communicate with the cabinet about increasing rights to abortion and codifying law. The U.S. cabinet refuses to meet with the Janes.</p>



<p><br>The Janes emphasizes that ever since the fall of Roe v. Wade there has been extremely limited access to abortion. The Janes&#8217; protest aims to &#8220;create true change for people with uterus’ across the nation&#8221; the Founder of the Janes said. The Janes has 2 demands for the U.S. government 1) Childcare, transportation, education, and paid leave and 2) a Public call upon states to publicly fund abortion services. The protest is using #WeAreJane to share abortion stories and document the protests and invites members of the public to use the hashtag. The rally featured posters with quotes &#8220;We Must be Heard,&#8221; &#8220;Pro-Life is a Lie!&#8221; and &#8220;My Body My Choice!&#8221;</p>



<p><br>It is now up to the cabinet to decide whether they will support the Janes&#8217; demands or hold firm with the lack of support for abortion rights.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="634" src="https://press.cimun.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-13-1024x634.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1201" srcset="/ipd-archive/XIX23/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-13-1024x634.png 1024w, /ipd-archive/XIX23/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-13-300x186.png 300w, /ipd-archive/XIX23/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-13-768x476.png 768w, /ipd-archive/XIX23/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-13.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">United Nations Security Council 1980</figcaption></figure>



<p><br>The United Nations Security Council (1982) is currently debating the Russian invasion of Afghanistan. The United States of America is attempting to temporarily suspend the USSR from the Security Council on the grounds of violation of the Geneva Convention. The USSR retaliated to this idea by threatening to wage war on the United States due to policy differences. The United States has answered as peacefully as possible, that they want to remain peaceful and secure the nation of Afghanistan.</p>



<p>However, finding a resolution that most of the representatives in the council can agree upon is proving to be a difficult task. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are going in circles,&#8221; said a representative from the USA. </p>



<p>The council is frustrated between reckoning with opposing views. The U.K. is neutral, Poland doesn&#8217;t support force against USSR, Zaire believes the U.S. should stop supporting the Mujahideen, China is in favor of stopping the war and the USSR plans to continue opposition, despite plans from global superpower the USA alleging that the USSR has committed war crimes.</p>



<p>Additionally, the U.S. and Japan are the only nations wishing to punish the USSR for their criminal actions. The remainder of the Security Xouncil refuses to condemn the Soviet&#8217;s action. Begging the question has the world lost its strength against the USSR? Even if the U.S. is the lone actor seeking action against Russia, the U.S. will act. The U.S. will stop at nothing to see communism fall and the USSR lose influence across the world.</p>

<p>Due to an error in reporting there was a misquote on behalf of the United States of America, they are not in fact working on closing the ports, but rather opening the ports. The U.S. has worked tirelessly to protect and support Ukraine during these troubling times and Le Monde takes all responsibility for the error. The U.S. is handling the situation in a responsible, well-timed manner. One of the most impactful things a nation can do to support a nation in crisis is to bolster its economy. In the directive the USA is working on, the U.S. is opening Ukrainian ports to export critical goods like grain not only supporting their economy but also their agricultural industry.</p>



<p>One of the epidemics the globe is facing is the catastrophe of world hunger, thousands of Tunisians, Libyans, and Pakistanis are starving because of the suffocation of the Ukrainian economy. By opening the ports Ukraine can begin to rebuild its GDP. Furthermore, opening Ukrainian ports is a soft offensive move towards Russia, the U.S. leading the stride to show Russia the world is watching them, and will not the attacks against Ukraine go without action. The security council is trying to reduce tensions in Eastern Europe, working tirelessly to create solutions to the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="blob:https://press.cimun.org/fd145130-5cb4-473f-9b6e-eb90b69f0584" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">UN Security Council 2023</figcaption></figure>



<p>The United Nations Security Council is navigating the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and debating on how to preserve and support Ukraine while treating Russia with continuous care. Currently, the UNSC has no clear plan, however noting that they have several ideas, yet nothing is secure. The crisis in Eastern Europe is causing U.S. gas prices to rise, causing inflation and unreliability in the American Economy. Russia is one of the main oil exporters, however, with the sanctions currently placed on them, Russian oil exports are at an all-time low.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Council has decided to focus on economic issues second and prioritize the food crisis resulting from the war in Ukraine. Ukraine is one of the largest producers of agriculture, mainly grain, resulting in the people of Tunisia, Libya, and Pakistan going hungry. The Council is tackling current emergency issues before looking to the future. The USA states that &#8220;If we provide a short-term solution Ukraine will be strengthened.&#8221; Since the conflict and post-pandemic society, the number of severely food insecure people doubled from 135 million pre-pandemic to 276 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russia is currently blocking Ukrainian exports not allowing the nation to send out food, not only deterring their economy but directly contributing to global starvation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Security Council is working on a resolution paper to &#8220;strongly advise Ukraine to close its ports&#8221; according to the USA. Ukraine closing their ports seized by Russia is a strong defence of Ukrainian sovereignty, whilst not putting the committee on the offence to Russia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The House of Commons is invested in finding the best way to support the economy and how to deal with the power grab of unions, ignoring the Falkland Islands crisis. Several Parliamentary members including Winston Churchill believed that the best way to support the British economy is to “increase interest value to decrease inflation.” Churchill fears that the UK is at risk of an economic depression. Churchill then questioned the prime minister about economic diversity, however, the Prime minister was unable to answer the question in full, leading to the question if the Prime Minister feels confident in their solutions to the economic crisis.</p>



<p><br>The Prime Minister is steering the committee into valuing workers&#8217; rights whilst warning parliamentary members that unions don’t support human rights and that union bosses are motivated solely by greed and selfishness. A parliamentary member emphasizes that human rights are stifled by unions.<br>The House of Commons is working towards deregulations in the British economy to let economies function to the best of their ability without unions undermining the effort.</p>



<p><br>Furthermore, the conservative party has split into factions. Half of the party aimed solely at ousting Margaret Thatcher from her position as Prime Minister, despite being a strong member of the conservative party. This divide has caused confusion about the other branch of the conservative party whose goal is to support workers&#8217; rights by restricting British unions.</p>



<p><br>The House of Commons is a tense, evolving situation that needs to be monitored closely as the split could cause emotions and a faction between the conservative party, leading to the labour party taking control of the House for the first time in years.</p>
