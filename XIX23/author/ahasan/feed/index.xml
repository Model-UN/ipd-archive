<p>Tragic stories are heard every single day about women and children getting abused. Countries and committees are scrambling to figure out how to fix this pressing problem. Some areas that suffer the most from the lack of women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights are Africa, South America, and some parts of south-eastern Asia. As of Feb. 2, 2023, the African Union is currently working on a directive that will fix the education system in Africa which promises to exponentially and drastically increase the number of jobs there are in the near future. This is amazing for Africa because they are known for their poor children&#8217;s rights and hopefully this directive will make Africa take a turn for the better.</p>
