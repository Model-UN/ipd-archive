										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On Sunday, the Iranian Ambassador to Russia released a statement to the New York Times stating that they had finally reached a deal with the Russian Federation. In exchange for admission into the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), the Iranians will make a number of concessions to the Russian Federation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Iranian and Russian militaries will begin joint military exercises along Iran&#8217;s Western border, the two nations will deploy their navies to the Strait of Hormuz, and seven percent of the Russian Air Force will be sent to support Iran. Additionally, Russia will be obliged to defend Iran if it is attacked militarily. This gives Iran significant backing if they were roped into a conflict with Western powers.</p>



<p>However, the Iranian cabinet is not waiting to be dragged into a nuclear war. They are ready to start a war themselves. In a statement released to the New York Times, an Iranian minister stated that Iran, &#8220;will be nuking Florida out of spite.&#8221; The Iranians also seem to want to enter the North Korean conflict. The Iranian Minister stated that Iran might nuke Korea because, &#8220;we want girlboss Kim Yo Jung to win.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a recent directive shared with the Times, the Iranians expressed a desire to &#8220;upload the Ayatollah&#8217;s consciousness to a computer,&#8221; and &#8220;enslave Charli D&#8217;Amelio &#8211; to be used as a defense mechanism in the Strait of Hormuz.&#8221; The New York Times was granted an exclusive interview with the Israeli Cabinet to discuss the Iran situation. The Israeli ministers dismissed the Iranian plans, stating that enslaving Charli D&#8217;Amelio was &#8220;not plausible,&#8221; and that they could simply &#8220;unplug&#8221; the computer version of Ayatollah Khamenei. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion, as the world enters a nuclear war, the New York Times is grateful for its readership, and wishes its readers the best during the coming nuclear apocalypse. Good luck everyone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In both North Korea and Iran, the situation is inching increasingly nearer to Mutually Assured Destruction (M.A.D.). China has publicly moved troops to the North Korean border after affirming the legitimacy of Choe Ryong Hae. The PRC is denouncing the rule of Kim Yo Jong, the de facto leader of the North Korean state, and has affirmed that &#8220;the best course of action is to engage militarily.&#8221; On Saturday, a Chinese whistleblower leaked further information to the New York Times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>China is actively using its military against the South Korean military at the North Korean Border. Additionally, the Chinese cabinet is making preparations to bomb Seoul with non-nuclear munitions. The whistleblower informed us that &#8220;the nuclear option was also brought up as a final straw.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Chinese have made plans for an attempted South Korean counter-invasion of China. Under the circumstance that South Korean forces cross the Chinese border, Beijing &#8220;will go nuclear.&#8221; A nuclear war cannot lead to a victory for any of the belligerents. To be as blunt as possible: This is not good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The whistleblower asked the New York Times to print the following statement: &#8220;By leaking documents to publications like yours I am doing everything in my power to prevent the doomsday scenario and I hope that everyone in my cabinet does the same, even if this includes overthrowing Xi Jinping who has been a notorious warmonger in this situation.&#8221;</p>



<p>As the possibility of a bombing, coup, or nuclear war increases, the world holds their breath. The New York Times will continue to keep you updated as the situation develops.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At the now-famous summit held on Saturday by Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United States, and Iran, an Israeli delegate made a chilling statement: &#8221; in case the Ayatollah decides to go forward with what he has said, we are prepared to enter into Iran with our troops.&#8221; Additionally, the Saudi king threw the possibility of a &#8220;preemptive strike,&#8221; onto the floor of discussion.</p>



<p>The last time &#8220;preemptive strike,&#8221; was a buzzword in the Middle Eastern news was in 1967, when the Israeli military launched a preemptive strike against its Arab neighbors. That military exercise is now known as the Six Day War. In the twenty-first century, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) are more powerful than ever, so it stands to reason that the Iranians should be quaking in their boots if Israel is planning a military invasion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Israeli ministers who spoke to reporters on Saturday seemed to feel like they were in a struggle of good and evil. The Israeli Minister of Infrastructure likened his country&#8217;s situation to that of Simba, the character from Disney&#8217;s <em>The Lion King</em>. The Minister went on to say that they would be teaming up with Timon (the United States) and Pumba (Saudi Arabia) in order to exact revenge on Scar (Iran). For readers who haven&#8217;t seen that particular children&#8217;s classic, the minister means to say that Israel will unite with its allies to ensure that it&#8217;s geopolitical rival is defeated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Israel seems to want to employ violence as only a last resort, one Israeli Minister told reporters that, &#8220;we have exhausted all the diplomatic solutions,&#8221; however, the Israelis also seem ready and willing to engage in military action that they deem necessary. One minister stated that, &#8220;We will not tolerate any more threats from them (Iran), and they should know that we are prepared to face them head on&#8221;</p>



<p>While Israel did not claim to be planning a preemptive strike, they did say that the Israeli troops in Saudi Arabia were, &#8220;preparing for anything necessary.&#8221; It appears that the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) troops may see action soon. The cabinet also told reporters that &#8220;we will fight back,&#8221; showing that the Israelis will certainly retaliate to any Iranian aggression.</p>



<p>Israel also affirmed that in the event of a major Israeli city being destroyed by a nuclear attack, &#8220;a nuclear response may be appropriate.&#8221; When asked if they anticipated the Iranians to make the first move, one minister said, &#8220;We hope that they will not, but if they do, we are militarily prepared for it.&#8221;</p>



<p>As the hours tick by, both Iran and Israel are facing the reality that conflict will likely emerge. The unknown factor is the extent of that conflict. In the coming hours and days, we will find out if noted poet T.S. Eliot was correct in his prediction that the world will end, &#8220;not with a bang, but with a whimper.&#8221; Let&#8217;s all hope that Eliot is right.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the classic eighties film <em>War Games</em>, the movie ends when a near-sentient computer avoids a global nuclear war when it learns the vital lesson that, just like Tic-Tac-Toe, nobody wins in a nuclear war. Unlike Tic-Tac-Toe (where every game ends in a cat&#8217;s game), a thermonuclear war ends with everyone dead (a far bleaker outcome). Nevertheless, Iran and Israel seem to have their fingers on the button.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the New York Times (and other outlets) already reported, an Israeli delegate stated that, &#8220;Our nuclear weapons also will stand at the ready as time continues onward, and God bless us all.&#8221; In an interview, an Iranian ambassador told the New York Times that, &#8220;To the question &#8216;will Iran deploy nukes if invaded?&#8217; I respond with this: &#8216;Would India use its nukes if it was invaded? Would the US? Would Israel?&#8217; Of course. Do not demonize Iran! We have our nukes so that we may never have to use them, you see?&#8221;</p>



<p>It should frighten the world that two nations are this close to detonating nuclear weapons. If Israel launched a preemptive nuclear strike, Iran will no doubt respond, which will no doubt provoke the United States, which will no doubt provoke China and Russia. Alternatively, if Iran launches a nuclear strike, Israel will no doubt respond, which will no doubt provoke Russia and China, which will no doubt provoke the United States. No matter the situation, everyone loses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This precept isn&#8217;t revolutionary, the idea of Mutually Assured Destruction (or M.A.D. for short) originated in the Cold War. But for some reason, global leaders seem anxious to put their finger on the proverbial big, red button. Why is this the case? Maybe the Ayatollah wants to seem like a strong leader for his people, maybe Israel wants to stay vigilant as a tiny nation surrounded by self-proclaimed enemies. Whatever the reason, it&#8217;s time for the Israelis and the Iranians to rematch War Games, or even just listen to some common sense. To the leaders of Iran and Israel, on behalf of the global community, fingers off!</p>

<p>The Iranian cabinet remains distracted from their upcoming presidential election as developments stemming from their nuclear ambitions are moving forward. When asked if any cabinet members have even declared candidacy, the Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs went so far as to say that, &#8220;under the circumstances, I do not think it would be wise (for any cabinet member to run).&#8221; The Iranians clearly want to avoid creating an internal political struggle, they are mired by large scale diplomatic negotiations between larger foreign powers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As tensions rise following Iran&#8217;s official statement regarding their intent to nuclearize, Iran feels threatened by the United States and its allies. Especially since the Americans, Israelis, and Saudis recently held a secretive tripartite summit. The Iranian Ambassador to Russia made an official statement to the New York Times regarding the recent communications between the three countries &#8220;Iran is not threatened by the U.S. and its imperial lapdogs, the State of Israel and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, although we are sure that it is their intention,&#8221; the ambassador proceeded to tell the Times that &#8220;we are the victim of arbitrary western-backed aggressions.&#8221; The New York Times attempted to reach out to an Israeli Cabinet Minister for a comment, but it appears that the Israelis are not ready to make a statement.</p>



<p>Privately, the Iranian cabinet ministers who were interviewed seemed to feel less than safe regarding the recent summit. The New York Times agreed not to publish the extent of these negative premonitions, but we will continue to report on those sentiments as the situation develops.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the West isn&#8217;t the only side of the globe interested in Iran. According to an anonymous whistleblower, a secret meeting occurred between the Russian Federation and the People&#8217;s Republic of China. During this meeting, Russia and China agreed to a tit-for-tat deal in which Russia would drop their involvement in the DPRK under the condition that China backs away from Iran. Putin reportedly ended the meeting by ominously telling the Chinese cabinet that, &#8220;Russia&#8217;s always up north and Russia is always watching.&#8221;</p>



<p>As Western and Eastern powers begin to work with their allies, there will no doubt be major developments in and around the Islamic Republic of Iran. Rest assured, the New York Times will be there to report on them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h6>OPINION</h6>



<p>Over the past few days, the media has been frantically covering developments in Iran. The product of this media frenzy has been honed into nuclear development, which is undoubtedly important. However, Iran has been on the center of the world stage ever since the days of Alexander the Great, long before the advent of nuclear technology. So why does Iran <em>really </em>matter? What&#8217;s so important about it that has led global superpowers to squabble over it for time immemorial.</p>



<p>There are a few reasons. In modern times, one of the major reasons has been oil. Iranian oil was discovered in 1908, and only a year later, the British had established the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC). By the advent of the first World War, Britain had bought up the majority of shares in the APOC and had effectively nationalized the Iranian Oil Industry. In the early 1950s, the Iranian people democratically elected Mohammad Mossadegh, a socialist who tried to nationalize the oil industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Americans and British, who benefitted from the oil, forced a coup, replacing the democratically-elected Mossadegh with a brutal, dictatorial regime. The reaction to that dictatorship brought us to the theocratic revolution that led to Iran&#8217;s current government.</p>



<p>But oil, which is almost cliche to mention in an article like this, is not the only reason that Iran matters. Iran sits at the crossroads between Asia and the rest of the Middle East. It has the potential to serve the Chinese and Russians as an avenue into the Arab World. But it could also serve as a Western bulwark, keeping Putin and Xi Jinping from dominating the Middle East.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iran&#8217;s strategic location, in addition to its oil and nuclear capabilities, is the reason that Iran matters. It is the reason that Xi Jinping&#8217;s Belt and Road initiative stretches towards Iran, the reason Russia has been trying so hard to impose a deal with the Iranians, and the reason that the United States has launched &#8220;Operation Porcupine&#8221; to meddle in Iran&#8217;s affairs. So, as you, the careful reader, explore the media landscape in an attempt to contextualize Iran, don&#8217;t forget that Iran&#8217;s global importance only begins at the nuclear arsenal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-center">Editorial</p>



<p>Even before the passage of the first amendment, the American media has served as a vessel for freedom of the press. From the Zenger Trial of the colonial era to the modern whistleblowers reported by today&#8217;s media outlets, the United States has always had a press that has remained autonomous from government control throughout the centuries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, this freedom has been put in jeopardy. After discovering that they had revealed sensitive information in front of a New York Times reporter during an open session, the United States government explicitly tried to restrict journalistic freedom. After expelling the reporter by entering a closed session, the Secretary of Defense messaged the New York Times. The Secretary claimed that, &#8220;all the information discussed in that conference was confidential and you can not use it.&#8221; Undoubtedly, this is a bold claim for the United States government to make.</p>



<p>&nbsp;This statement, the Defense Secretary proves an age-old saying: history repeats itself. In 1971, after the New York Times released the damning Pentagon Papers, the Nixon administration tried to censor the newspaper and stop the publication of the classified materials. A legal battle ensued and the case was taken to the Supreme Court. In a 6-3 decision, the Burger court upheld freedom of the press, thus creating a milestone in the history of journalistic freedom.</p>



<p>The sentiments of the American cabinet members do not reflect the constitution or the results of New York Times v. United States. The New York Times endorsed President Biden, and maintains its support for his administration. However, the hypocrisy of the Secretary of Defense&#8217;s comment does not bode well for journalists. The comment, frankly, is un-American. The New York Times strongly encourages the Biden Administration to reaffirm its commitment to journalistic freedom, so that the legacy of the Zenger Trial and the Pentagon Paper exposé isn&#8217;t lost to history&#8217;s vicious cycle. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the wake of the death of North Korean head-of-state, Kim Jong Un, The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has been discussing responses to the North Korean situation. The Security Council developed two major resolutions, one supported by a majority of the delegates, the other headed by a firebrand delegate from South Africa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The favored paper, which eventually passed with an overwhelming majority, is sponsored by the UK, France, Russian Federation, and others. The resolution comprehensively advocates for a plan to push North Korea towards democracy. The leaders of the majority paper hope to use diplomacy and the removal of sanctions to push the North Korean leadership towards establishing democratic rule. The French delegation commented that, &#8220;we can&#8217;t make change without them (North Koreans) at the table,&#8221; highlighting the importance of working with the North Korean leadership and not against it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are concerns that the majority paper isn&#8217;t hard enough on North Korea and would be unable to stop the North Korean military from retaking power. Specifically, there is concern that North Korea would expel the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors called for by the resolution. In a statement made to the New York Times by the United Kingdom&#8217;s delegate, the representative reassuringly noted that there is a clause in the resolution allowing for the deployment of UN Peacekeepers in the case of IAEA inspector expulsion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The minority paper, which failed to garner a majority vote, advocated a much more aggressive stance. The paper, led by South Africa, Vietnam and Tunisia, advocates war as a contingency for North Korea&#8217;s unwillingness to transition to democracy. In a comment, the South African delegate said, &#8220;War is a necessary evil (but) we must make sure that North Korea stops its current death camps.&#8221; South Africa likened the majority paper to appeasement, implying that its passage will only lead to an inevitable rise in totalitarianism in North Korea.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the majority paper passed, promulgating policies that aim to promote peace. The North Korean situation is undoubtedly rocky, and there will no doubt be rapid developments on the Korean peninsula. Hopefully, the resolution passed by the UNSC will bend the arc of geopolitical development towards peace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the upcoming Iranian Presidential Election, Iran&#8217;s ministers seem laser-focused on a completely different issue: Nuclearization. In recent weeks, rumors began to circulate about the possibility of the Iranians reaching nuclear capabilities. This Friday, those rumors have become reality.</p>



<p>  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, reported the recent beheading of the Iranian Minister of Energy. Wasting no time in appointing a replacement, Ayatollah Khamenei appointed the Minister of Science to take on the role of heading the Ministry of Energy this Friday. Ayatollah Khamenei expressed hopes that the new head of the Energy department would, &#8220;lead Iran to nuclear power.&#8221; </p>



<p>The Iranian government, which has historically been extremely secretive about its nuclear program, is openly discussing plans for nuclearization in governmental meetings. In a session that admitted a New York Times delegate, The Iranian Chief of Staff noted that &#8220;the western media is well aware of our intentions,&#8221; showing that the Iranians fully understand that they&#8217;re nuclear ambitions are no longer a state secret.</p>



<p>Some Iranian delegates seemed incredibly optimistic about their prospects, making bold claims about Iran&#8217;s geopolitical rivals. Iranian Major General Mohammad Bagheri even went so far as to say that &#8220;The U.S. President Joe Biden can be easily manipulated.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>President Biden and his administration seem to have no intention of being duped. Before entering a closed session, The United States cabinet debated the merits of a summit with the Iranians to address the nuclear situation. Many cabinet members were optimistic about the prospects of negotiating with the Iranians, hoping to deescalate the situation through diplomacy. However, some cabinet members, like Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, expressed reservations about the Iranian&#8217;s willingness to meet face to face. In the open session, Secretary Blinken cited Iran&#8217;s historical unwillingness to engage in diplomacy as a reason to seek a better alternative for addressing the situation.</p>



<p>As the Iranian nuclear situation develops, the global media will no doubt be watching Iran, its allies, and its rivals. The next few days will no doubt be headlined by major developments as Iran&#8217;s new Minister of Energy begins to carry out the Supreme Leader&#8217;s wishes, and as the global superpowers prepare to address those developments.</p>
