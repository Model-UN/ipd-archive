<p>After much deliberation, members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have come to a consensus on the crisis in Korea.  According to the resolution that was unanimously passed, there will be multiple new systems and programs created to help solve the crisis.  ASEAN has suggested the “creation of the ‘Pacify and Peace Program’ with the intent to foster international communist actions with Korea&#8230;form relations and negotiations with North Korea.”  This program seems to promise healthier relations between North Korean and members of ASEAN.  Additionally, the committee recommended “the creation of an ASEAN peace treaty with North Korean and Iran to denuclearize their arsenals.”  Seeing that the nuclear crisis in Iran had caused much uproar among the international community, it is reassuring to see that the committee has worked to solve any potential similar crises in the future.  Lastly, ASEAN “responds to nuclear weapons usage in the Southeast Asian region, ASEAN 6+ by applying the use of economic sanctions on the nation responsible&#8230;and preparing for military actions.”  The resolution passed by ASEAN seems to be promising for the health and prosperity of the international community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since the announcement of Iran’s furthering of nuclear development, nations around the world have voiced their views on the situation.  Specifically, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Committee had been discussing and negotiating situations similar to that of Iran.  During the interview with the Iranian leader, hinted that North Korea could pose a nuclear threat.  This notion has caused much panic among the international community.  </p>



<p>Buzzfeed was given the opportunity to interview Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, on the subject of North Korea.  Harris declared “The United States is giving military aid to the People’s Liberation Front of Korea and supporting our South Korean allies in the midst of this crisis, meaning that while we are not putting United States boots on the ground, we are giving the Liberation Front money so that they can fight for a free, fair, and democratic North Korea.  Above all, we are for the safety of innocent civilians, so if North Korea continues to push for nuclear development, we will obviously have to take military action, since we cannot let innocent lives be jeopardized.”  Based on the statement made by Harris, the United States is seeking peace and diplomacy with Korea.  However, the United States will not hesitate to use military force if the threat of nuclear action is presented.  While no one is sure of North Korea’s next steps, Buzzfeed will keep you updated with any action that occurs.</p>

<p>Iran has officially begun to develop its nuclear weapons program. Recently, the Iranian leader stated that this is what happens when western nations do not have power over other countries, like Iran and North Korea.</p>

<p>Since the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been discussing the situation in the Korean Peninsula, it can be assumed that the Iranian leader is seeking to foreshadow North Korea’s next move.</p>



<p>This news is extremely important to not just ASEAN members, but countries around the world. Currently, the committee is collaborating and discussing this crisis.&nbsp; We will let you know of any updates as they become available.</p>

<p>The South China Sea conflict, that has been plaguing much of the world for over a decade, has finally been resolved.  The ASEAN met to discuss, amend, and vote on the two proposed draft resolutions.  It is now clear that they have made enough amendments to the draft resolutions, as both of them have passed.  Seeing that this conflict is seeking to be resolved by the passing of the resolutions, economic prosperity, free trade, and peaceful summits should be expected around the world.  While the issue of the South China Sea conflict has been discussed, debated, and resolved, the committee is now moving on to the situation on the Korean Peninsula.  We will keep you updated as more nations speak out on this issue.</p>

<p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been hard at work seeking solutions to the South China Sea conflict.  After extensive discussions, the committee has presented two separate resolutions. </p>



<p> In a bloc led by the Philippines and Laos, the notions of summits and economic growth were prioritized.  This draft resolution seems to promote peace and prosperity among nations around the world, especially those involved in the South China Sea issue.  Vulnerable nations have been promised protection through this resolution as well.  China has expressed concerns over the free trade plan that the Philippines bloc has presented.  </p>



<p>Conversely, in a bloc led by China, the issue of free trade was emphasized, this draft resolution seems to promote freedom of trade to all members of ASEAN as well as the option to participate in said program.  The Philippines has shown concern over the exclusiveness of this program, as it is limited to members of ASEAN and excludes all western influences.  Meanwhile, China has demonstrated its willingness to make amendments to its draft resolution.  We will update you with more specifics as they become available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-left">Trade is and has always been an issue of the South China Sea conflict.  Recently, there have been ongoing discussions of a free trade plan involving the South China Sea.  While some nations of ASEAN believe that this would benefit multiple economies, others are rather skeptical of this plan.  Indonesia and Malaysia believe that China must be a part of this trade agreement, as they and many other countries depend heavily on China’s economy.  China has spoken out on this issue and expressed concerns about the exclusion of other countries, such as Western nations in this free trade agreement. They are  specifically worried about potential exploitation of nations.  The Philippines has sided with China and mentioned that globalization is becoming more and more prevalent to the international community, especially with regards to trade.  We will keep you updated with more news as it becomes available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>China has stated that they believe that it is crucial for Western countries, like the United States and Russia, to not be included in the conflict of the South China Sea. The Chinese government has claimed that these countries have no right to an opinion and only seek to further their political reach.</p>



<p>Furthermore, it was suggested that members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, also known as ASEAN, come together to discuss potential solutions to the issue of the South China Sea Conflict. Other countries such as Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia, have expressed their support for the Chinese sentiments and objectives. Sovereignty has become an important topic of conversation regarding the issue of the South China Sea and possible solutions, we will keep you updated on this unfolding issue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The situation in Southeast Asia has been plaguing the world for months. In November 2020, it was reported that the United States advised China to avoid the use of violent military force against Taiwan. However, this has not seemed to have an impact on China’s actions, as they have looked towards the annexation of Taiwan. Many countries have expressed their opinions over this issue, mainly stating that they would prefer to have all actions remain peaceful.</p>



<p>“We strongly believe in adhering to the desires of both the United States and China through diplomatic measures that ease tension in the region,” the representative of the Philippines said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the past decade, the South China Sea crisis has been one of major discussions in the global trade market.&nbsp; The South China Sea dispute involves both the island and maritime claims by everlasting sovereign states within the region, namely Brunei, The People’s Republic of China, The Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. An estimated $3.37 trillion worth of global trade passes through the South China Sea annually. This accounts for a third of the global maritime trade. 80 percent of China’s energy imports and 39.5 percent of China’s total trade passes through the South China Sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The main conflict, the South China Sea crisis, has caused the nation of the Philippines much political and economic stress,” the representative from the Philippines also said.</p>



<p>Various nations, including the Philippines, have endured the great burden that tensions between China and the United States have created.&nbsp; While it seems as if there is no end in sight, multiple representatives have come together to discuss potential solutions to this pertinent problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A main source of tension between the United States and China stems from trade disputes.&nbsp; Therefore, interjecting as the ASEAN to promote a joint trade force can be one of the many possible options,” the representative from the Philippines also said.</p>



<p>While China and the United States press on with their own agendas, nations across the world are suffering and hoping for a solution.</p>
