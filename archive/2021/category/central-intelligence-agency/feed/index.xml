										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After reports stating the CIA involvement with the conflict in Belarus and growing international pressure, the United States seems to be pulling back within Belarus. The Russian Federation and the United States were at a nuclear standoff due to the mounting violence in Bealrus yesterday, but overnight the tensions have calmed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The negative international reaction to the United States’ war-mongering tactics and aid has seemed to cause their cold feet” Sukhoi-TMC Ministry Deputy McDonald said.</p>



<p>The mounting conflict in Belarus began when President Alexander Lukashenko was shot by an opposition leader, now believed by some of the ministry to “be working for the Americans&#8221;. The military leader Victor Khrenin became the new President of Belarus due to his high ranking in the government by Lukashenko. The CIA aided in cutting power, networks, and internet service for three hours in order to put Pro-Democracy Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya in power. The United States’ action disregarded the elections by the Belarusean people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vladimir Putin has spoken to the ministry discussing the importance of ensuring peace and safety in Belarus and “keeping the United States and their corruption out”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The ministry will continue working to protect the security and safety of the Belarusean people,” Deputy Alian said. “The blatant imperialism of the Americans should not be tolerated and the sovereignty of other nations should be respected.” </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The United States actions in regime change around the world, most recently in Belarus, should not go unchallenged. The corruption and lack of democracy within the United States has been showcased through the actions of the Department of Defense (DOD) and the CIA and their intrusion into the affairs of Belarus. American imperialism and war-mongering disturbs the peace and safety of citizens and solely promotes the American agenda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CIA’s actions resulted in causing a three hour blackout within the capital of Belarus and implementing Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya as President. The people of Belarus began protesting against Sviatlana’s governance and her unethical actions that put her in power. The United State’s actions in aiding the government change show that there is no regard for international law and no importance in recognizing the sovereignty of other countries. Therefore, the United States government and NATO need to pull out of Belarus and face punishment from the international community for their actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What happened in Belarus was a tragedy and it almost led to a new war and threats of a nuclear attack. The international community should join the Russian Federation and President Vladimir Putin in condemning the US government and Biden administration for their mistakes and lack of respect for the people in Belarus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The corruption and lack of knowledge of these attacks by the Biden administration illustrates the failing of the American superpower and their lack of morals. In order to ensure safety and peace in the East and in other nations hurt by the United States, the international community needs to hold the United States accountable for their horrendous actions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Sukhoi-TCM Ministry has discovered evidence of CIA involvement in Belarus that directly led to the presidency of Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. The Joint TMC-Sukhoi ministry released a statement to Russia Today, detailing their reaction and condemning the United States.</p>



<p>“The Joint TMC-Sukhoi taskforce, on behalf of the Russian Federation, would like to condemn the CIA and its affiliates for their manipulation and destabilization of the Belarusian region that has led to countless atrocities. We have well grounded evidence that they have taken these actions. Now is the time for the world to take a definitive stance in order to hold NATO accountable for their unethical actions. For far too long, the United States and their affiliates have undermined the sovereignty of developing and unstable countries and unjustly accused truthful nations of heinous acts. They have caused chaos and destruction. They have toppled governments and taken the lives of innocent bystanders. They have created opportunities for themselves by creating conflicts and disregarding the path of destruction they have left. The Joint TMC-Sukhoi taskforce is taking a stand against the tyranny of the West. We call our fellow nations in the East to stand with us as we condemn these perpetrators of countless meaningless wars.<br>With discontent,<br>Joint TMC-Sukhoi Taskforce of the Russian Federation”</p>



<p>The ministry has been outraged by the CIA involvement but they “are not surprised” according to Deputy McMahan, due to the past actions of American imperialism. The ministry is springing to action bringing forth directives for Putin to call on the U.N. to condemn the United States, calling for Sviatlana’s resignation, greater surveillance to protect against further unethical U.S. involvement, and mobilization of forces to ensure the security and safety of the Russian and Belarusian people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A new democratic government led by President Svetlana Tikhanovskaya has taken power in Belarus, but the newborn democracy is far from stable. The Russian Federation has thus far acted slowly and has not made any direct responses, apart from vague threats of sanctions and possible future intervention. The United States, on the other hand, has congratulated Belarus on its newfound freedom and is believed to be directly supporting the new government (though the assassination is still believed to have been entirely domestic in nature). The landlocked Eastern European nation saw 26 years of dictatorial rule come to an end this week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An anonymous source has informed <em>The Washington Post</em> that there is serious concern that the current plan of action was poorly thought out. The source suggested that internal discussions between the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Department of Defense (DoD) are growing hostile as the two agencies struggle to formulate a conclusive plan which both parties can agree to pursue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an open memo to President Biden, the CIA accused the DoD of “worryingly aggressive” and “warmongering” behavior. The deployment of U.S. troops inside Belarus near the Russian border would certainly be an act of war, so both the CIA and the DoD must tread carefully. There are growing concerns inside the CIA that the DoD may initiate an armed conflict, which one insider described as “practically starting World War III”. The CIA memo also questioned the leadership of the DoD, reiterating concerns that they were “dangerous,” while the memo also called the DoD’s plan “unnecessarily violent and foolish.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Though the Central Intelligence Agency also supports the cause of Belarusian democracy and the sanctity of free elections,” the memo says, “American Troops in the region, without the support of our allies, will only tarnish the image of America in the view of our allies and our rivals. The right approach, alongside allies, with methodical deliberation, and with the full range of American Diplomatic effort, would have been infinitely preferable”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CIA’s full memo can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MeRT_xNRV9Jme2nzq-zRe3cpQ424C4iIPf2oeKWgjTA/edit">here</a>.</p>



<p>As for Russia, they have yet to take military action in Belarus, but it appears to be preparing for conflict following the Federation’s recent nationalization of the Sukhoi and Tactical Missile Corporation. Russian state media network RT has called for the U.S. to not deploy troops in Belarus, and Russian President Vladimir Putin called the U.S. involvement in Belarus “a blatant act of American imperialism” before warning “if this can happen in Belarus, this can happen anywhere.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Joint Ministry Sukhoi-TCM received knowledge of a summit of the CIA and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) to discuss the current conflict in Belarus. The CIA and United States have aided in the regime change that resulted in the Presidency of Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya despite her loss in the 2020 election.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ministry believes that the United States’ action within Belarus is “war-mongering” and their plots “of war on sovereign nations should be condemned,” Deputy McDonald said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Americans enrollment in eastern politics is an outrage, quite frankly it&#8217;s hypocritical. They created documents such as the Monroe Doctrine to prevent outside influences in their regimes, yet they impose on eastern world politics&#8221; Deputy Alien said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An insurrection movement has begun against Tsikhanouskaya for abusing utility and technology and her suppression of technology in Belarus. Tsihanouskaya utilised US aid to cause a three hour blackout of all power and media and put herself in power, and the people of Belarus believe that her actions were unethical and corrupt. The citizens participating in the insurrection are considered “courageous” by the ministry Deputy Edmond said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ministry is discussing how to advise President Vladimir Putin on the course of action and ensure the protection of Russian citizens and keep peace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I believe Russia should denonce Belarus and its administration, remove all influences of them, for Russia to hear the people of Belarus, inspire them to revolt, let them choose and create an alliance with Russia,” Deputy Alien said “ its nation’s economic salvation can be the Sukhoi-TCM.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As tensions rise in Belarus, with fifteen protesters just shot and killed, with violence increasing, the United States and CIA aid to the opposition is only creating more conflict. At noon, electricity, cell service, and internet service all went out for exactly three hours. As soon as utilities returned, a televised broadcast was beamed to all television in the country. This message consisted of the newly named President Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who addressed the nation, stating that “Democracy has won”. Directly following, armed security forces have locked down the city and arrested prominent pro-Russia figures.</p>



<p>This is following an election and polls where the legitimate government of Belarus and leader Viktor Khrenin has been supported by the majority of the Belarusean citizens. The Russian government has immediately blamed the United States for the cyber-attack and arrests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a blatant act of American imperialism, and if this can happen in Belarus this can happen anywhere,” President Vladimir Putin said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In reaction to the American intervention, the Tactical Missile Corporation and Sukhoi were merged and nationalized under the Russian Federation to form a new ministry to ensure security and protect the Russian Federation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Belarus is close to an all out war, due to the intervention of the United States. The United States has a history of involvement in regime change, that lead to ousting of the elected and supported governments, and in turn years of war, genocides and conflict. The United States and the West needs to stop interfering with other nations affairs under the ruse of protecting people, Belarusean people identify with the Russian Federation and should not be subject to conflict at the hand of the United States. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>New leaked information from the U.S cabinet confirms that their actions regarding Iran’s recent nuclear program goes far beyond diplomacy and support.</strong></p>



<p>The cabinet of the United States of America is planning on taking strong military action if needed in the Middle East regarding Iran’s nuclearization. In a classified directive written on February 5, 2021, the Cabinet clearly states that they will be prioritizing intelligence operations conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), in order to keep constant surveillance on the Irani suspected nuclear sites. This operation has been named “Operation Porcupine”, and is being conducted in cooperation with Israel and Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>The United States also stated that they will be ready in case of conflict, announcing that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will be coordinating with top generals in secret on creating possible plans of attack. The Joint Chiefs of Staff will also coordinate with regional commanders to ensure that American troops are ready in case of conflict. Some of the discussed actions were; to increase training frequency, testing for missile system effectiveness, requesting reports from generals on the United States’ capability to defend against nuclear attacks, and to work with local militaries to increase cooperation.</p>



<p>Israel and Saudi Arabia have also&nbsp; been alerted of the current situation, and were asked through a series of letters to not engage in any military action regarding the situation in Iran yet. Allies all over the world have also been warned of possible aggressions and actions by the Irani cabinet, and to be ready against any situation.</p>



<p>The United States of America is also prioritizing peaceful talks with Iran through a summit, wanting to remain as transparent and pacific with news media chanis around the world. In case of this not working, the world should be prepared for military action and violence. President Biden and the new administration&#8217;s approach to conflict like this is still in doubt, but the possibility of a new Middle East war is increasing every minute.  BBC News will be following the topic very closely throughout the next couple of days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>William Burns, a former state department employee and war veteran was nominated for CIA Director by President Biden. If confirmed by the Senate, he will be the first director whose experience throughout life has been from the State Department. Burns worked in foreign service for 33 years, retiring in 2014. He is currently president of the Carnegie Endowment for National Peace, a think tank known and respected worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Burns has been critical of former President Trump for his failure to calmly accept election defeat, and even predicted this rough exchange of power last August. &#8220;Like so many other features of the Trump era, the transition would bear little resemblance to any before, or any of the many I served through as a career diplomat. The costs of confusion, mixed signals, and bureaucratic turmoil could be very high.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Burns has similar beliefs as President Biden about how “intelligence must be apolitical,” which Biden believes is important to serving the nation. Burns appealed to Biden because he seemed capable of restoring trust in the CIA after Trump&#8217;s presidency. Burns also has expertise with Russia, which is needed after the Trump era. Burns also served as deputy secretary of state in the Obama Administration, and has worked under 5 American presidents from both parties.</p>



<p>Burns’ nomination was handed to him, as his other contenders had previously agreed with the use of torture programs, which was deemed unacceptable by Democrats on the Senate Intelligence committee.</p>
