										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It is official; the CIA and Boeing are partnering to buy UAVs. An anonymous source states that the CIA has bought UAVs is “just in case anything goes wrong with Iran and Belarus.” However, according to a delegate on the Security council, the real threat is The United States and China, who have been attacking the South Korean side of the demilitarized zone and are massing on the North border. The move has been applauded by freedom-loving Americans everywhere. </p>



<p>The situation in North Korea and Iran has escalated; The United States is threatening military force and China has already moved troops to demilitarized North Korean Borders. The DPRK’s government is fighting among themselves, and is not able to win against the united forces of the South and China. Boeing is proud to stand with America and the CIA to protect freedom at home and abroad.</p>



<p>Boeing stands with all Americans in these trying times, and encourages all Americans to have faith in America&#8217;s airlines. Readers who use the code &#8220;BOEINGUSAFREEDOM&#8221; at participating airlines will receive $73.70 off of their flights. And remember: There is no safer way to travel than Boeing!*</p>



<p></p>



<p>*<em>By using the code on eligible flights, you are waiving your rights to sue boeing in the event of further 737 failures. Plus you&#8217;d be dead if it happened anyways so who cares? Book that flight you cowards. Boeing cares about AMERICA.</em> </p>



<p>**Also. legally we have to tell you that Boeing has purchased the Chicago Tribune, not out of fear of bad press, but because we LOVE the free press. You can still see all coverage of Boeing on the Chicago Tribune, but really its AirBus you have to watch out for. I think they hire anyone over there. Probably a bunch of idiots.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Mixed discussions taking place in General Dynamics’s boardroom paint a picture of a company preparing for drastic action, with disregard for the consequences or a great deal of common sense. “Back to blackmailing the DOD…” stated a General Dynamics executive, before discussions commenced regarding supplying arms to Russia. Executives also suggested providing pizza, free of charge and topped with green peas, to the world, although reasonable suspicion exists that this was a press stunt in order to disguise their real, much more sinister ideas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Suggestions put forth by the board included sabotaging Lockheed Martin by framing them for bombings, blackmailing opposing executives, bombing the headquarters of competitive companies, and telling foreign executives “Your wife cheated on you!” It was not made clear the exact purposes of these actions, but it’s glaringly obvious that the rest of the world is no match for the might of General Dynamics and its pizza-enthusiast executive board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On Sunday, the Iranian Ambassador to Russia released a statement to the New York Times stating that they had finally reached a deal with the Russian Federation. In exchange for admission into the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), the Iranians will make a number of concessions to the Russian Federation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Iranian and Russian militaries will begin joint military exercises along Iran&#8217;s Western border, the two nations will deploy their navies to the Strait of Hormuz, and seven percent of the Russian Air Force will be sent to support Iran. Additionally, Russia will be obliged to defend Iran if it is attacked militarily. This gives Iran significant backing if they were roped into a conflict with Western powers.</p>



<p>However, the Iranian cabinet is not waiting to be dragged into a nuclear war. They are ready to start a war themselves. In a statement released to the New York Times, an Iranian minister stated that Iran, &#8220;will be nuking Florida out of spite.&#8221; The Iranians also seem to want to enter the North Korean conflict. The Iranian Minister stated that Iran might nuke Korea because, &#8220;we want girlboss Kim Yo Jung to win.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a recent directive shared with the Times, the Iranians expressed a desire to &#8220;upload the Ayatollah&#8217;s consciousness to a computer,&#8221; and &#8220;enslave Charli D&#8217;Amelio &#8211; to be used as a defense mechanism in the Strait of Hormuz.&#8221; The New York Times was granted an exclusive interview with the Israeli Cabinet to discuss the Iran situation. The Israeli ministers dismissed the Iranian plans, stating that enslaving Charli D&#8217;Amelio was &#8220;not plausible,&#8221; and that they could simply &#8220;unplug&#8221; the computer version of Ayatollah Khamenei. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion, as the world enters a nuclear war, the New York Times is grateful for its readership, and wishes its readers the best during the coming nuclear apocalypse. Good luck everyone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With former CEO of Tactical Missile Corporation Boris Obnosov appointed the new President of Belarus, the largest shareholder of the corporation, Tony Soprano (Big Tony), was named the new CEO. The Italian mafia gained control of Sukhoi-TMC and now hope for  “the Russians to start becoming Italians” Soprano said. The corporation hopes to restore the glory of the mafia. </p>



<p>“In order to reclaim the Italian heritage, we must end the reign of Domino’s,” Smaller Tony said. The ministry is discussing the response to Boeing’s creation of a lightsaber business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new mafia-led ministry hopes to “start a civil war between Domino’s and Papa John’s and turn New Jersey into an empire” Soprano said. The ministry is joining the Boeing Corporation and repeating the mantra “HEY IM WALKING HERE” over and over to “assert their dominance,” Mafia Joe said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Over the weekend, the push by administrators for delegates to purchase merch for the Chicago International Model United Nations conference (CIMUN) has escalated. From Friday’s brief mentions of the merch URL to Saturday night’s trivia-night showcase and Sunday morning’s aggressive pitches by the CEO of Bluebird Aero Systems, CIMUN merch has become a focal point of the conference.</p>



<p>The aforementioned website contains a wide variety of CIMUN merchandise, including shirts, mugs, masks, and hats, all with the CIMUN logo. Many purchases have already been made, but staff continue to push delegates to make purchases, providing a promotional code as well as sketchy incentives for purchases, with Bluebird’s CEO stating that delegate awards will be given on the basis of merchandise purchases.</p>



<p>Since no reporting body can be entirely neutral, the <em>Jerusalem Post</em> has linked below the URL of CIMUN’s much-promoted merchandise website.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Two global superpowers, the United States of America and Russia, may be on the brink of potential military conflict in the small landlocked Eastern European nation of Belarus. Since the assassination of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko a few days ago, a U.S.-backed democratic opposition government has come to power led by Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, but the state is still very much unstable. Russia has been conspicuously quiet on the matter in recent days but it believed to be preparing for war, albeit much more covertly. The U.S. is believed to be directly supplying the new government, and are also believed to be using modern tactics involving social media and internet memes to influence public opinion amongst the Belarusian people.</p>



<p>Reports early this morning suggest that the Department of Defense has acted in Belarus without the approval of the White House and Commander-in-Chief. A CIA insider reported that “the DOD lied about the presidential approval” which raises serious concerns regarding co-operation within the government. In a CIA memo revealed yesterday, the Agency called the Department of Defense “dysfunctional” and questioned their decision-making. Though the Department of Defense is yet to make any sort of public response to the allegations, sources in the Department described the CIA as “a tough batch”.</p>



<p>Will internal struggles between different institutions in the U.S. government prevent America from coordinating a viable and consistent response to a conflict on NATO’s doorstep? If the trends of recent hours continue, that may well be the case.</p>

<p style="font-size:13px"><strong>The Irani Cabinet came into agreement with Russia, creating a new partnership to respond to alleged Saudi Arabian Attacks.</strong></p>



<p>The Israeli cabinet held a successful meeting with the Russian Cabinet regarding humanitarian aid and nuclear resources . During the discussions after this agreement it was mentioned several times the possible killing or Attack in Saudi Arabian Soil. The King and main oil refineries are among the targets of the Irani cabinet, as well as possible . The following statement was passed by the Cabinet:&nbsp;</p>



<p>To the people of Iran, we as a Cabinet have recently voted unanimously to join the CSTO with the Russian Federation. The Islamic Republic of Iran now considers the Russian Federation a strong nuclear superpower that we call a friend. Russia has recently protected our sovereign nation from a Saudi Arabian attack on our nuclear program. In response to this attack on our nation, the Cabinet of the Islamic Republic of Iran has decided to respond to the Saudi Arabian attack by attacking oil refineries in Saudi Arabia and ports on the Strait of Hormuz. We have also decided as a Cabinet to increase naval presence on the Strait of Hormuz. Any military action that will be taken in the new future are in response to the aggression of the imperialist west.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iran also showed full support to the Chinese government after the attacks in South Korea, and it&#8217;s happy for “non-imperialist”&nbsp; adversity presented to the United States of America. This alliance with Russia could bring more stability to their situation in the Middle East, but it could also mean a more catastrophic war between G5 nations. The BBC will keep you informed of any new updates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After reports stating the CIA involvement with the conflict in Belarus and growing international pressure, the United States seems to be pulling back within Belarus. The Russian Federation and the United States were at a nuclear standoff due to the mounting violence in Bealrus yesterday, but overnight the tensions have calmed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The negative international reaction to the United States’ war-mongering tactics and aid has seemed to cause their cold feet” Sukhoi-TMC Ministry Deputy McDonald said.</p>



<p>The mounting conflict in Belarus began when President Alexander Lukashenko was shot by an opposition leader, now believed by some of the ministry to “be working for the Americans&#8221;. The military leader Victor Khrenin became the new President of Belarus due to his high ranking in the government by Lukashenko. The CIA aided in cutting power, networks, and internet service for three hours in order to put Pro-Democracy Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya in power. The United States’ action disregarded the elections by the Belarusean people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vladimir Putin has spoken to the ministry discussing the importance of ensuring peace and safety in Belarus and “keeping the United States and their corruption out”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The ministry will continue working to protect the security and safety of the Belarusean people,” Deputy Alian said. “The blatant imperialism of the Americans should not be tolerated and the sovereignty of other nations should be respected.” </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The executives of Bluebird Aero Systems, the fast-growing Israeli technology company, have sparred over a wide variety of ideas for expansion of their services. A general consensus was reached regarding the benefits of partnering with global governments, with executives showing significant desire to establish more formal ties with the United States government for both civilian and defense-related technology sales. Upon request for comment, Bluebird’s Vice President of Government Affairs stated that, “Bluebird would positively regard a partnership with a foreign nation,” although no specific nations were mentioned. Expansion is also being considered into states with the potential for high use of these aircraft, with the potential for future contracts existing with India and many Middle Eastern nations, while demonstrated animosity exists towards the idea of a contracted partnership with Russia.</p>



<p>Reportedly, a few members of the executive board have also expressed interest in joining the Israeli Defense Fund, a step that would tie the corporation even more closely to the Israeli government and provide increased linkage with foreign partners, including the United States. This push has been spearheaded by Bluebird’s Chief of Operations, who has emphasized the importance of international cooperation. While a directive has been drafted in this matter, its status is unknown as of press time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of Sunday morning, Bluebird has passed a directive proposing a formal partnership with Boeing after extensive discussions. This partnership will be a collaboration between the two businesses in order to develop more advanced technologies, including aeronautics systems, and progress a joint green initiative. Boeing has not yet formally agreed to the partnership, and updates will be provided as the partnership is formalized.&nbsp;</p>
