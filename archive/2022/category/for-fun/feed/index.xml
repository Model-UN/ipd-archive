<p>Russia and Turkey embody the early stages of the Disney Princesses from the movie Frozen, Anna and Elsa. In Frozen, Anna sings <em>Do You Want To Build A Snowman</em>, one lyric in this song is &#8216;we used to be best buddies, and now we&#8217;re not&#8217;. This refers to Russia and Turkey being very good trading partners but then President Erdogan of Turkey screaming at Russia and asking them to take a, &#8220;Big fat L.&#8221; As you can see, Russia and Turkey are no longer best buddies.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization can be seen in Encanto&#8217;s Isabella. When you first look at both of them, you think that there is nothing that could go wrong with them, no drama, nothing. Although, if you look inside and find their true selves, you see that there is actually quite a lot of inner drama. For Isabella, it was the cacti and for the WHO, it was the claims of espionage and racism.</p>

<p>The US is like Sleeping Beauty because when they were not paying attention, similar to when Aurora was sleeping, their kingdom was invaded by outsiders. In the US cabinet, that example would be the Russians but in Sleeping Beauty, it was the thorns that took over her kingdom as she slept for 100 years.</p>

<p>Finally, China is like Moana because in the movie of Moana, the main character broke several rules as she left her home island of Motunui. In the same way, China has broken several treaties by making the decision to nuke many other countries.</p>
