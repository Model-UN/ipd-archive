<p>Russia has made it clear that they are trying to increase the positivity that they put into their public image. The Russian Ambassador to the United States has stated, &#8220;The current view that Russia is the enemy is purely incorrect. We, as a country, are working incredibly hard to mediate and moderate the Belarusian and Bosnian crisis and this is just one way we want to show the world that we are not bad and that Russia can be a collaborative force&#8221;</p>



<p>Although, in a recent interview with the United States Secretary of Defense, it was made clear that the country of the US is very doubtful towards Russia&#8217;s so-called &#8216;improved global reputation&#8217;.</p>



<p>In the Secretary&#8217;s words exactly, &#8220;Watch what they do, not what they say,&#8221; she continues on, &#8220;Look at the past and see what they are doing now.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another source from within the US Cabinet also states that they are extremely ambivalent about Russia&#8217;s new global stance. They believe that Russia as an ally would be helpful but they too are concerned about Russia&#8217;s past actions and are unwilling to completely trust them. </p>



<p>With all this information, what do <em>you</em> think Russia&#8217;s real motive is?</p>
