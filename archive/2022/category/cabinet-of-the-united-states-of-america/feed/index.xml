<h2 id="the-original-issue-better-opportunities">The Original Issue/Better opportunities</h2>



<p>Starting from the being of the conference the PRC cabinet talked about working on their directives and by that they&#8217;ve managed to come up with a way to better their economy by not having funds to involve new housing development and working on the green energy plant.</p>



<p id="better-opportunities">Further on after the session the cabinet has managed to find a way to positively increase their representation to the media. From my interview with the minister of finance we talked about better <ins>china&#8217;s</ins> housing issue <ins>[</ins>from the housing bubbles<ins>]</ins> by providing funds and using the green energy they&#8217;ve been producing and assuring regards of the twitter leak of the U.S. file that china is making astounding progress and making sure<ins> that their nation stays strong. China also prides itself on making nuclear energy into positive energy, but from those outcomes china has also been working on their space stations and possible building up their current space station and</ins> have discussions on improving their resources for the area and the minister of finance has been working with companies for supply of the space station.</p>



<h3 id="early-conflicts">Early Conflicts</h3>



<p>From the meeting between the U.S. and China there was a very outraged dispute about whether both of their leaders dictatorship was valid and during the meeting the U.S. cabinet thinks they offered china a deal which the representative of trade offered &#8221; 10% of debt towards the U.S and we would want a allyship because we think it would be better for our economic structure and we don&#8217;t require a answer now. Shortly after the Chinese cabinet was outraged and thought &#8220;The deal was a hand held offer that benefited the U.S more than us,&#8221; the minister of finance said.</p>



<p>During the meeting the U.S. judged China&#8217;s dictatorship causing disruption and a outbreak of very hostile disputes and the PRC feels as they were disrespecting their president as the U.S. feel as they were &#8220;verbally abused&#8221; according to theSecretary of the U.S. when gotten to that point. President Biden also feels as they were the &#8220;most mature&#8221; party after his contributed outrage and feels as China was stepping out of line and the secretary of the U.S. feels as &#8220;China has completely overstepped their boundaries and has gone off the rails and they need us more than we need them.&#8221;</p>



<p>When talking to the PRC they stated that the deal  was &#8220;disgusting and disrespectful&#8221; and they will not need to take it upon them as they have bettered their economic value and have shown great leadership to helping with Bosnia and working with the Russian cabinet to help better funds, housing, military and etc.</p>



<h4 id="the-humiliation-of-the-ex-director-of-the-cia"><strong>The humiliation of the ex-Director of th</strong>e CIA</h4>



<p>Before the conference the CIA director asked me if I could spread information on the PRC and intentionally tried blackmailing me into giving information about the cabinet and later leaked documents from the U.S. cabinet personally to me as he told me to realize them and then blamed by fellow delegate BuzzFeed of releasing them. Later he told me that they accused china of sending cyber threats and planned to do the same back. He also asked me to mention this &#8220;We tried helping china for no other reason than ( We are nice) which was dumb. Then they decided to insult us when we went in the cabinet meeting and what did we get as a payback? Literally nothing.&#8221; He also stated that the U.S. was going to do a coup. </p>



<p>From the Twitter leak &#8220;the anonymous&#8221; source of the cabinet has held many closed sessions regarding the documents and after trying to send spies into the Chinese cabinet, persuading them and initially manipulating them, the PRC refused any discussion with him and other delegates.</p>



<p>Breaking news broke out that when he was found out for treason, leaked sensitive U.S. documents that have realized plans regarding many other cabinets.And so forth his failed attempts to not only the public, his cabinet and others have made him irresponsible delegate and some would say &#8220;crossing lines.&#8221; with his actions and responses as I can only imagine what his cabinet feels towards the betrayal of his actions. Further action has not been reported but he was fired from the position and arrested for treason of U.S. property.</p>



<h4 id="improvements-with-bosnia-and-social-ties">Improvements with Bosnia and Social ties</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized is-style-default" datatext=""><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQxZutsqrOjOp9Fkk8Hx2i4AjsMM9I0BY0ozA&amp;usqp=CAU" alt="" width="345" height="244"/></figure>



<p>The PRC and Russian cabinet have been in communion into helping Bosnian citizens and country and the Russian cabinet has made a warm-hearted comment as &#8220;Russia believes having a new republic will help for bettering Bosnia and gives a special thanks to China&#8217;s cabinet with helping with Bosnia&#8217;s economic issue,&#8221; Milorad Dodik said. Russia is also more than happy and would love to improve their ties with China and believes it would be better for social and economic value, as for Russia&#8217;s only goal is to help other countries and diminish their image of being a hardship country.</p>



<p>The PRC is proud to be a representative into making Bosnia a better country as for their media actions have proven and shown leadership for the smaller country. The cabinet has also using their new energy source (green energy) and has provided funds for Bonsai by sending 100Â¥ and has given military to them and assured that the money will be used responsibly and can only hope with this opportunity that the cabinet has given them that their economy will be improving rapidly!</p>

<p>lol Hi! It&#8217;s me again: your favorite #HuffPostInfluencer and Blogger coming back for round two. I just got off of several calls with members of the WHO and am happy to report back with (mostly) good news. If you want a more entertaining summary of this article, feel free to follow the Youtube link: https://youtu.be/mXsNrPQXJd8</p>



<p>If you think you take yourself too seriously, proceed at your own risk. </p>

<p>After trying, and failing, once again to weasel my way into the too-cool-for-school 2022 USA Cabinet at the top of Session 3, I cut my losses and did a U-turn into the World Health Organization. </p>



<h2 id="why-can-t-i-be-cool-enough-for-the-cabinet-of-the-usa">Why can&#8217;t I be cool enough for the Cabinet of the USA</h2>



<p>I shall save the hot goss for last, so scroll down if you don&#8217;t care about the &#8220;boring stuff,&#8221; and just want to know which two countries are duking it out in the World Health Organization right now. </p>



<h2 id="the-triple-d-resolution">The Triple D Resolution</h2>



<p>I first spoke with the WHO delegate of Trinidad and Tobago about the Distribution, Discipline and Dedication, Triple D, or DDD, resolution underway at the WHO. The goal of the resolution is to create equality in vaccine distribution. </p>



<p>The goals of the resolution: </p>



<ul><li>Attempts to build huge facilities in each major region of the world. </li><li>Partnership between the WHO and Doctors Without Borders (bringing more doctors to underdeveloped nations) </li><li>Educating citizens: creating an easy-to-use educational page on the WHO website and utilizing social media </li><li>Creating a partnership between countries with low vaccination rates (under 75%) and countries with high vaccination rates </li></ul>



<p>The initiative will be primarily funded by the People&#8217;s Republic of China, as well as the World Bank, New Zealand and Israel. The delegate of Trinidad and Tobago informed me that they will also be seeking funding from private and governmental institutions across the world. Let&#8217;s place bets on whether or not the USA will get involved. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Our greatest focus with this initiative is the partnering of underdeveloped countries with countries that have high vaccination rates.&#8221;</p><cite>WHO Delegate of Trinidad and Tobago</cite></blockquote>



<p>First world countries with high vaccination rates are expected to manufacture and provide vaccines for their developing counterpart, providing education to the developing country, helping to create vaccine facilities within their developing partner, among other initiatives. The delegate of Trinidad and Tobago cited Israel, and Trinidad and Tobago, as an exemplar partnership due to the surplus of vaccines within Israel and the potential for sharing them with Trinidad and Tobago. </p>



<h2 id="underdeveloped-countries-for-equitable-vaccine-distribution-by-nigeria-kenya-and-paraguay">Underdeveloped Countries for Equitable Vaccine Distribution by Nigeria, Kenya and Paraguay</h2>



<p>The WHO delegate of Paraguay reached out to me for an interview at the very beginning of todays (February 5th) sessions, in order to discuss a paper which their team is currently working on, the <em>Underdeveloped Countries for Equitable Vaccine Distribution </em>paper. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Our paper focuses specifically on underdeveloped countries. I think this really sets us apart from everyone else. Everyone else that we have heard from is talking about the major world powers, and all of their donations, but no one is acknowledging the fact that developing countries have different needs than those of developed countries when it comes to equitable and sustainable vaccine distribution.&#8221; </p><cite>WHO Delegate of Paraguay </cite></blockquote>



<p>The delegate is disgusted by the fact that developing countries are fully reliant on &#8220;handouts&#8221; for the time being, as they lack the resources to develop their own vaccines and facilities. She explained that most developing countries have been forced to survive off of the hand me downs of more powerful countries, being given vaccines which have almost expired or have already expired. The delegate cited a lack of effective and/or safe storage procedures in developing countries as one of the main reasons for vaccine waste in developing countries. </p>



<p>Nigeria, Kenya and Paraguay have joined forces in order to confront these challenges. The team intends to partner with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the building of vaccine manufacturing facilities in the Global South: establishing a dependable source for vaccine manufacturing and creating jobs in developing countries. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really look at it (the financial involvement of the Gates Foundation) as a handout. I look at it as an investment.&#8221; </p><cite>WHO Delegate of Paraguay</cite></blockquote>



<p>The declaration of the UCEVD as an investment is especially exciting to me, as the infrastructure established by this agreement will, no doubt, continue to serve developing countries in new ways if we are to ever face another Global Health Crisis. The delegate of Trinidad and Tobago is to act as a signatory for the initiative. </p>



<h2 id="drama-in-the-world-health-organization-the-hot-goss-if-you-will">Drama in the World Health Organization (The hot goss, if you will)</h2>



<p>Now is the time for the piping hot tea. An anonymous source has informed me that in WHO meetings, Israel and Lebanon are incessantly butting heads. The source is a member of the World Health Organization, and therefore has access to all WHO committee sessions and has witnessed the behavior first hand. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Israel and Lebanon refuse to work together due to political clashes involving vaccinating Palestinians.&#8221; </p><cite>Anonymous WHO Delegate </cite></blockquote>



<p>In addition to the tensions rising between Israel and Lebanon, there has been increased tension between Delegates of the World Health Organization and the Chair. The chair has, allegedly, stated that sponsors for both the Triple D Resolution and the Underdeveloped Countries for Equitable Vaccine Distribution Initiative <strong><em>must </em></strong>be of the &#8220;economically sound, more developed countries.&#8221; The anonymous WHO delegate informed me that this puts many delegates&#8217; papers at risk, and is therefore hurting the underdeveloped countries which could use the support. WHO delegates are upset by these restrictions, and tensions only continue to grow. </p>



<p>Although, on a more positive note, my anonymous source alleges that sparks are FLYING between the WHO delegates of Cuba and Israel, as Israel uses the dynamic to her advantage: manipulating the UCEVD to the favor of their signatories. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized" datatext=""><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/archive/2022/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-632" width="400" height="263"/></figure>



<p>Russia has made it clear that they are trying to increase the positivity that they put into their public image. The Russian Ambassador to the United States has stated, &#8220;The current view that Russia is the enemy is purely incorrect. We, as a country, are working incredibly hard to mediate and moderate the Belarusian and Bosnian crisis and this is just one way we want to show the world that we are not bad and that Russia can be a collaborative force&#8221;</p>



<p>Although, in a recent interview with the United States Secretary of Defense, it was made clear that the country of the US is very doubtful towards Russia&#8217;s so-called &#8216;improved global reputation&#8217;.</p>



<p>In the Secretary&#8217;s words exactly, &#8220;Watch what they do, not what they say,&#8221; she continues on, &#8220;Look at the past and see what they are doing now.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another source from within the US Cabinet also states that they are extremely ambivalent about Russia&#8217;s new global stance. They believe that Russia as an ally would be helpful but they too are concerned about Russia&#8217;s past actions and are unwilling to completely trust them. </p>



<p>With all this information, what do <em>you</em> think Russia&#8217;s real motive is?</p>
